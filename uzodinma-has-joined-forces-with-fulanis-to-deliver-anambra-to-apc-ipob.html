Neither IPOB members nor ESN operatives were among those purportedly killed by the Army in Nnobi two days ago. We don’t know why Nigeria Government always likes to cover the truth and peddle falsehood.</p><p>“What happened was that they mistakenly killed some criminals and terrorists recruited by Supreme Court Administrator in Imo State, Hope Uzodinma and APC (All Progressives Congress) party to wreak havoc in South East. These bunch of hooligans are the ones unleashing mayhem on our people in the name of ESN just to implicate and demonise IPOB. But nemesis caught up with them.</p><p>“Nigerian Army thought they killed ESN operatives not knowing it was bandits recruited by Uzodinma that they killed. They now wanted to cover up by tagging them IPOB members but unknown to them their deceit cannot be covered up anymore.</p><p>“It’s no longer a secret that Hope Uzodinma in his desperation to please his slave masters, the Fulani caliphate, is employing all manner of strategies to deliver Anambra State to APC but our people must resist him.&nbsp;</p><p>“This was part of his pact with the Caliphate before they gave him the governorship of Imo State through the kangaroo judgement of the Supreme Court. Some gullible minds don’t yet understand the game. But the oppressors know that IPOB knows their antics. That’s why they are after us.</p><p>“We want the media to summon the courage and ask Nigerian military to tell them whom they killed at Nnobi Anambra State and they should stop linking IPOB to what happened at Ekwulobia Aguata two days ago.</p><p>“Hope Uzodinma created unknown gunmen thinking that he will implicate IPOB and ESN but God is working against him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49qZq6yn5m2r7nAZp%2Baq12fvKq6xJ1kn6eimLK0edaiq6Fllqq5orrIrGStp12Zsq211Z6pZpmelrqjvsBmq6hlkaWwbrXPqJlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./september12-html.html><span>←</span><span>September 12 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
