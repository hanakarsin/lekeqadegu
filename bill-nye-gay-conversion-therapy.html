No, it's not a choice. And no, gay conversion therapy won't magically make someone heterosexual. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Rights Campaign</a> states that the practice can lead to "depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide."</p><p>Bill Nye addressed the issue in an episode of the show, pointing out how ludicrous the argument for conversion therapy is by turning people into different flavors of ice cream.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Sound like anyone you know?</p>"I just think if you want to get right with the big ice cream in the sky, change your flavor by wishing to be vanilla. Everyone should pretend to be vanilla, until they no longer have the urge to not be vanilla!"&nbsp;<p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the cartoon has caused some controversy. The YouTube video has 2,000 likes compared to 16,000 dislikes and conservative media isn't liking it, either.

The so-called scientist is just one of many who are trying to shove their liberal views down our children’s throats, and it needs to end."<p>While Megan Fox of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PJ Media</a> claims that the episode "ended up sickening&nbsp;the Twittersphereand giving ISIS more reasons to hate us." &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fox writes:</p>"If sexuality is what you are, then why is it okay to make the heterosexual change his flavor? I thought that wasn't possible. Is Nye suggesting that peer pressure is a good way to get someone to change his or her sexuality? I thought we are supposedly born this way. If that's true, then no amount of coercion should be able to change one's orientation, unlike what happens to poor Mister Vanilla, who is basically gang raped."&nbsp;<p>Honestly, I'm fine with giving ISIS more reasons to hate us.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYGOaWhoamCOurF9jpugpaRdo8amecaasGabn6PDpr7SoqanZaSdsrOtz7I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-can-drag-yul-edochie-the-whole-family-is-tired-of-him-cousin.html><span>←</span><span>'You Can Drag Yul Edochie, The Whole Family Is Tired Of Him'</span></a>
