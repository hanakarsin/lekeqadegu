An overview of the TikTok sensation.</h2><p>Like many TikTok trends, narrowing down who was the first to say standing on business is challenging. However, <a href=#>Druski</a> was one of the first influencers with a large platform to express standing on business in his content.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Druski, known for routinely going viral on social media, posted a TikTok about “Standin on Business” in September 2023. The video, titled “Dudes Say ‘Standin on Business’ BUT DO THE OPPOSITE,” used examples of how some men pretend to be one way on their online profiles but fail to deliver in their actual lives.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In his video, Druski’s examples included men flexing about how much money they make, though they can’t afford to shop for the designer clothes they desire. He also showed himself rapping “Standin on Business,” followed by him “pulling up” on a group of men, stating he’s “standing on business” and then running once he realized they were down to tussle.</p><p>So, what does the phrase mean? When you’re on business, you show up for yourself and do what you say you will do. Rather than saying you’re one way on social media or elsewhere, you’re living that way and not making your circumstances greater (or worse) than they are. If you don’t, the people around you will know you’re not “standing on business.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>As TikTok user Mrs. “Kit-Kat” Williams’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">(@kitkatintheclassroom)</a> high school students explained when the teacher discussed standing on business in one of her “Lit Lingo” videos.

Since the expression surfaced, many online users share how they practice the mantra on TikTok, X, formerly Twitter, etc.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the most popular ways to apply standing on business is in romantic relationships. If you’re sick of <a href=#>dealing with an F-Boy</a> who refuses to see your worth, you can stand on business by no longer speaking to him (her, them, etc).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, once you’ve blocked them, you have to stand firm in your decision, as you aren’t standing on business anymore by resuming communication.</p><p>In addition to romantic relationships, standing on business can apply to your professional life.
