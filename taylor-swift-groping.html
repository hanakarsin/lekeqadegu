To drive that point home, she sued Mueller for just $1. It'd have been easy for people to say that she was looking to get an easy payout from Mueller or that she was going to crush him with her legal might just to line her pockets, but by only suing for $1, Swift actually lost money and made a powerful point. She was doing it for a specific purpose.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Jury sides with Taylor Swift in groping lawsuit, orders fired radio host to pay the pop star a symbolic $1.</p>‚Äî The Associated Press (@AP) <a href=#>August 14, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Swift said $1 is for an "example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts." <a href=#>#TaylorSwiftTrial</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/aieVFsWZG0</a></p>‚Äî Dago Cordova (@dago_deportes) <a href=#>August 14, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift hugs her attorneys and mother after verdict is read.
