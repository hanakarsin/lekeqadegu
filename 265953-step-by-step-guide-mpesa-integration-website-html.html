Businesses who want to utilize their M-Pesa payment gateway services must be ready to spend some substantial amount of money. They have very high quotations. For JampoPay to set up an account for you, be prepared to part with a minimum of Ksh 150,000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9adf66dc4899b7c8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>NHIF M-Pesa Paybill number for contributions, penalties, and employers</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Mpesa Rates 2018: What You Will Pay for Your Mpesa Transactions</p><p class=align-left>If you are an online startup trader, JamboPay isn't the best choice for you when it comes to M-Pesa integration to the website. Continue looking online you will find a viable solution that will suit your budget and business needs.</p><h2>PesaPal Payment Gateway</h2><p class=align-left>The second option would be PesaPal. They will prove to be very helpful to online merchants who have their websites constructed on WordPress. WordPress websites integrate with the payment gateway offered by PesaPal quite easily. The PesaPal WordPress repository has several free plugins which enhance the process of accepting M-Pesa payments on your merchant website. Their big challenge is that they don't provide ample information to customers on their official website.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the available WordPress repository plugins available on PesaPal are:</p><ul><li>The PesaPal Pay Plugin</li></ul><p class=align-left>PesaPal Pay uses shortcodes that allow merchants to collect donations and payments made via M-Pesa. The shortcodes that are used by PesaPal Pay include, [pesapal_donations] and [pesapal_pay] used for receiving donations and payments respectively. Business owners who are very familiar with coding will find this plugin very helpful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/62cab65535d9c266.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Making bulk payments through Safaricom's B2C service</span></p></a><ul><li>The WooCommerce PesaPal Standard Payment Gateway</li></ul><p class=align-left>This payment gateway offers a technical extension to the WooCommerce’s functionality, allowing merchants to charge for their goods through mobile payment services, like M-Pesa. During the installation, the developer advises customers to use the API and the demo consumer key.</p><ul><li>PesaPal Gateway for WooCommerce</li></ul><p class=align-left>The plugin is user-friendly for merchants who already have the WooCommerce downloaded and installed on their WordPress websites. After downloading the plugin from the repository of WordPress, unzip the plugin and upload through the FTP to the wp-c0ntents/plugins. Activate the plugin on the Dashboard of your WordPress admin website. Access the WooCommerce Settings, then click on the PesaPal icon. You will be required to enter your generated PesaPal API Key and the Consumer Secret. After completing this, you can begin receiving payments via mobile money (M-Pesa).</p><p class=align-left>Of course, Safaricom has their online payment gateway; consumers have the option of using the Lipa na M-Pesa that is available on the M-Pesa menu. If you are interested in getting the details if the Safaricom online payment application, you have to call or email the customer support to be provided with the details. PesaPal Payment Gateway offers the most affordable M-Pesa integration to website services.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlW5wbmtdqMGmvIybsGarpJq9brPUopueZZ2lsrStjKKlrZ2Xp661tc6nZLCdkqi2tbGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-hillstrand-html.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Hillstrand - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
