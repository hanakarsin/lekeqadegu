What does "SB" mean in the Olympics? You'll see it used when an athlete does really well.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Runners compete during the men's 1500 m semi-final on Day 9 of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris at Stade de France on Aug. 4, 2024.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does "SB" mean in the Olympics?</h2><p>Simply put, "SB" in track and field stands for "Season Best." This little symbol denotes when an athlete puts on a performance that beats out the rest of their runs during the most recent season. It doesn't necessarily mean it's their best time ever, which would be marked by "PB," or Personal Best.</p><p>Track and field — or Athletics, as it's referred to internationally — is full of acronyms that can explain what's going on with a particular athlete. "DQ," of course, means disqualified, and "DNF" stands for "did not finish," meaning that the competitor couldn't complete their race.</p><p>Another racing acronym, which is much rarer to see, is "DNS," or "did not start." This means that, for whatever reason, the athlete wasn't able to make it to the beginning of the event. This recently happened to Jamaican runner <a href=# style=text-align:start>Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce</a>, who did not show up to compete in the Women's 2024 100-meter Semi-Final.</p><p>While rumors suggested that her absence was due to being <a href=#>barred from the arena</a>, it seems that this was pure speculation. Instead, Jamaica's chef de mission Ian Kelly told Reuters that she did not compete due to an injury sustained while warming up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaivbrnEmqVmoZ5ivK3FzKmgnKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./241571-msichana-anayedaiwa-kuwa-mkenya-amchinja-bosi-wake-ngambo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Msichana, anayedaiwa kuwa Mkenya, AMCHINJA bosi wake ng'ambo</span></a>
