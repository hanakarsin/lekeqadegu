One such question fans have maintained for some time now is if Karen has had a facelift procedure done — something that has caught steam thanks to her youthful looks.</p><p>So, did Karen — who was born in October 1962 — ever have a facelift or any other medical procedures that would have altered her appearance? Keep reading for everything that we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Karen Laine ever actually have a facelift? She has certainly had procedures done in the past.</h2><p>With her youthful appearance, the question of whether Karen has ever had a facelift is one that many fans have brought up over time via social media and other means. However, Karen has not listed a facelift among the procedures she has had done. Still, it seems that her looks aren't attributed to just good genes alone, as she has gotten some help from new-age technology as well, specifically targeting her face, stomach, and arms.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post on Aug. 20, 2020, Karen elaborated on some of the procedures she has had done to keep her looking as young as she does.</p><p>"I get many comments asking what I do to look so young," she led off by saying in the caption. "One of the things I do is PRP microneedling. Your own blood is drawn to create platelet-rich plasma, which is then painlessly micro needled into your skin."</p><p>Karen explained that the delicate procedure was done by her son William Starsiak and that she is thrilled with the work. "If you go to him, you will love him as much as I do and be as biased as I am," she said, posting one image of herself while the procedure was underway and another 36 hours later when it had fully healed.</p><p>This isn't the only elective procedure the star has had done, however. Thanking Starsiak Aesthetics, she posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before-and-after of her stomach</a> in July 2021 to show the progress of "EmSculpt Neo." This refers to a non-invasive treatment that works to replace fat with muscle through radio waves. Karen also shouted out her son's company when she posted in January 2021 about using CoolSculpting on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arms and abdomen</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecqaqZ6mXaS7brPOqJtmmp%2BjsrR5x5qtnmWRYrOir8SloJ%2Bs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./459803-top-10-famous-crying-footballers-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Famous Crying Footballers</span></a>
