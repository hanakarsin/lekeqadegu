In fact, the power of the Federal Government, in which whoever is elected president controls virtually all the resources, beheads the reality.</p><p>“There is fear that if more resources go to the states and local governments, given what we see in Nigeria now, many people are afraid that it cannot solve the problems, but my own thinking is that the more power and resources in the state and local governments the less attractive the federal becomes. Then, more people will concentrate in terms of bringing appropriate reforms and development. It is very important we truly address these issues.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BvZrCdXZ2ut7GMraZmqpWZwqSxjK2fnmWgpMSmvoyonWasmJp6sb7ErKCdnZ6peqOxxaipnmWknbJufo9rbmadnJqwtbXOp6pmopWcrnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-disick-html.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Disick - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
