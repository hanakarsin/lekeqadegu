He should cover his face in shame that in all they claim to be in the North, they have succeeded in running the country down. If his people could not salvage the country, let them allow the Igbo man to go there and rescue it.</p><p>“This vitriolic attack and campaign of calumny will not stop an idea whose time has come. We are prepared to rule Nigeria anytime, any day just as we have succeeded in the things we do, so shall we succeed. Let them allow Obi to rule for eight years and let’s see whether there will not be a positive change in this country.</p><p>“Kwankwaso cannot claim he knows more than other Northerners that have ruled the country and the earlier he understands this and submits to superior reasoning, the better for him. Obi can never be his running mate. It is rather himself that should accept to become Obi’s running mate.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49uZqmdpJq%2FbrvBomSyp6Viu7C%2B06Gcq6aVp8BusMSsq6unqZqxbrrIoJyroZFiubF5wqGgnp6klravecGlmKyso2K4uK3NpK6aq59k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./255316-mcheshi-maarufu-nchini-atamani-ardhi-ipasuke-immeze-hai-baada-ya-kuanikwa-vi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mcheshi maarufu nchini atamani ardhi ipasuke immeze hai baada ya kuanikwa vibaya na mwigizaji Mkenya</span></a>
