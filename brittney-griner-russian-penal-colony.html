Thankfully, we can report that on Dec. 8, 2022, Brittney was freed in a prisoner swap for convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout. The exchange occurred on Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>.</p><p>The outlet also noted that President Biden spoke with Brittney by phone from the Oval Office. He was joined by <a href=#>Brittney's wife Cherelle</a>, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Moments ago I spoke to Brittney Griner.</p><p>She is safe.<br>She is on a plane.<br>She is on her way home. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FmHgfzrcDT</a></p>— President Biden (@POTUS) <a href=#>December 8, 2022</a></figure><p>"She is safe, she is on a plane, she is on her way home," Biden said from the White House on Thursday morning. "She will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along."</p><p>Biden added, "This is a day we've worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release. It took painstaking and intense negotiations, and I want to thank all the hardworking public servants across my administration who worked tirelessly to secure her release."</p><p>Cherelle also spoke at the White House, thanking several people who helped ensure her wife's release. "Today my family is whole," she said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>. As of this writing, Brittney is on her way to San Antonio for a medical evaluation, per standard procedure for freed U.S. prisoners. Cherelle will meet her there, an administration official told CBS News.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brittney Griner is coming home.</p><p>Just incredibly good news.</p><p>Thank you to President Biden and everyone in the administration who made this happen, as well as the advocates who pushed for it. <a href=#>https://t.co/xwAIyArOoK</a></p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=#>December 8, 2022</a></figure><p>As many celebrate Brittney's release on social media, others are deeply concerned about U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan.

He said, "This was not a choice of which American to bring home. Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up."</p><p>Cherelle Griner also announced that she and Brittney "will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul [Whelan], whose family is in our hearts today as we celebrate [Brittney] being home."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>NEW from the Whelan family: "There is no greater success than for a wrongful detainee to be freed & for them to go home.
