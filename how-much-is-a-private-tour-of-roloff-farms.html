What began as "34 acres of possibility" on Matt and Amy's property has transformed into more than 100 acres of outdoor entertainment — including a pumpkin patch, a castle, western village, pirate ship, corn maze, and much more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roloff Farms</a>, which is located 15 miles west of Portland and just north of Hillsboro, Ore., offers a ton of family fun — especially in October <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during pumpkin season</a>. However, some guests desire a more personal experience on the gorgeous property. Which is why there is the option of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking a private tour</a>.</p><p>Naturally, fans of Little People, Big World have wondered: How much does a private tour of Roloff Farms cost? Let's take a closer look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much is a private tour of Roloff Farms?</h2><p>If you're looking to take a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private tour of Roloff Farms</a>, expect to pay a premium price for the experience. A flat fee of $300 will get you a private, 30-minute tour for up to three people, according to the Roloff Farms website. Each additional person after that costs $25 apiece, with a maximum of eight people. (Kids 3 and younger are free.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tours are offered every day of the week all year long, and reservations can be made up to 30 days in advance.</p><p>"We enjoy sharing the beautiful landscape and behind the scene stories of Roloff Farms," the website reads. "Each tour will visit the famous farm attractions that you may already be familiar including the Western Town, Molly’s Castle, The Twins’ Swamp Fort, Matt’s Bridge, a visit to the Secret Forest, the Tower of Terror and so much more!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>According to the website, each Roloff Farms private tour will be guided by Matt, Zachary, Amy, or Jeremy, who "will share fun stories and current tidbits going on at the farm." But we have a feeling this information hasn't been updated in a while.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That's because <a href=#>Amy recently sold her half of the farm</a> to Matt. Not to mention, Jeremy has moved several hours away from the farm, to Bend, Ore., making it not very feasible for him to be spending a ton of time working there. So we wouldn't expect to see Amy or Jeremy guiding many — if any — private tours of Roloff Farms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Actually, it looks like Zach will probably be the one leading the way if you ever plan to take a private tour of the farm.</p><p>"No matter what's going on with the family, we always come together for pumpkin season," Matt explained during a Little People, Big World episode shot in October 2019. "Zach, this year, has really taken ownership over the private tours."</p><p>In the same episode, Zach shared that he had been doing private tours at Roloff Farms for three or four years.</p><p>"I like doing private tours because they're very manageable, it's small group of people," he said. "I can kind of create a relationship — a real relationship — not a, 'Hi, how's it going?' relationship. I'm in control of the situation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another note: If you actually go to book a private tour right now, you'll notice there are no dates available, likely because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic/social distancing guidelines that have followed as a result.</p><p>Hopefully, Roloff Farms will be back up and running — as well as the private tours — by the time pumpkin season arrives in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFlmah6onnPq6CvmaSaerW71KtkqJ5dp7ytu8WfZJ%2BZoqLA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-hicks-2020.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What 'Lemonade Mouth' Actor, Adam Hicks, Is up to These Days</span></a>
