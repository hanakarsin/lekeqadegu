He has just filed a case in court and is coming up tomorrow (today, Monday).”</p><p>Although the details of the suit were still sketchy Sunday night, another source in the APC said Ozekhome was taking up the matter “for certain constitutional interpretations.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49yZqOto6l6qrqMnqSenpmauaZ5x56Ynatdqbxur86uqa1lkah6s8HLoqWgZaCWv7XFjJymp56Zp7q0ecKbpWafn6uys7rOq2Siq12Weq6xzJucq2Wfm3qivMJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./67840-html.html><span>←</span><span>Edo State House Of Assembly Suspends Deputy Speaker And Three Lawmakers</span></a>
