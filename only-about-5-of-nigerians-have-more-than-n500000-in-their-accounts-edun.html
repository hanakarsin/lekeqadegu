And on that point, I must emphasize that when we talk about the last eight years before Mr. President came to power, there was this liquidity built up.</p><p>“The Issue was that the funds were going to a few. Only about 5% of the population have bank accounts that have more than half a million in them. So, the majority was left out for eight years. They are on the sidelines while a small minority enjoyed.</p><p>“That is the major correction being made by Mr. President now. That is the major microeconomic reforms that have put in place.</p><p>“So therefore, government revenue that was outside the federal government consolidated revenue funds have been brought back to the government funds,” Edun said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FtZqimnK56oq7OrqtmbV2ks266yKCcq6GRo8ButMCvnGaln6eybsDHmqVmpmVlfXF8j2agp2WknbKqvoyampynpaPBtHnEnaynZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-gibson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Henry Gibson - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
