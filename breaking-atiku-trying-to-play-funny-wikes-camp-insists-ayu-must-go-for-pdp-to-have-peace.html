We will remain in PDP and work for its success but can’t campaign alongside Ayu.</p><p>“Ayu has demonstrated partisanship in the handling of the crisis in the party. Aside praising (Aminu) Tambuwal as the game changer for stepping down for Atiku at the presidential primaries, we are also aware of the role he played in scheming out Wike as the vice-presidential candidate.”</p><h2>Atiku’s Controversial Interview</h2><p>The governor also slammed the former Vice President for granting an interview to Arise Television, which has now escalated tension in the main opposition party.</p><p>He berated <strong><a href=#>Atiku Abubakar</a></strong> for stating during the said interview that Ayu can only step down as national chairman if he wins the presidential election.</p><p>“We were already making progress but the recent interview granted by the presidential candidate worsened the whole issue.</p><p>“If Wike who was aggrieved could maintain silence, why can’t he (Atiku) do the same? “In the interview, he said Ayu can only step down if he wins the presidential election.</p><p>“That was not the agreement we had before the national convention where he (Ayu) was elected the national chairman. Every right-thinking person in the party, including Ayu, knows that.</p><p>“If they are now trying to play funny, we will also prove to them that we are key stakeholders in the party and we will fight this battle to a logical conclusion,” the governor said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49sZpuqlZa4qrrGZpitoZuqerW%2B2KKloGWkpHqxuMCyZJ%2BtnqPGbsPIpJysZZOWurF5yKeqoqukqHqixdRmpK6rpGK0sHnFqKlmqJSlerW7jKGYr51dpbKir8Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-paul-pogba-handed-four-year-ban-from-football.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Pogba Handed Four Year Ban From Football</span></a>
