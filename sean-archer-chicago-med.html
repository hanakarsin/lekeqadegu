In the Season 7 finale, we discovered that Gaffney Chicago Medical Center newcomer Dr. Dean Archer had been harboring a secret. His tough, no-nonsense exterior came tumbling down in the final episode when he placed a call to his estranged son, who we now know as Sean."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
