In fact, the vests are even equipped with a GPS tracking device that will inform players and trainers on how to improve each individual's on-field performance.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A number of European Football clients in action mid-week;<a href=#>@FCBayern</a> <a href=#>@valenciacf_en</a> <a href=#>@PSG_inside</a> <a href=#>@FCPorto</a> to name a few <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UdQsfR0E7v</a></p>‚Äî GPSports (@GPSportsSystems) <a href=#>March 2, 2016</a></figure><p>However, anyone can purchase a stat vest.

"A lot of blood so I can't take it off. Unfortunately," Danielle added after alleging that in other interviews people had made fun of the surprising look.</p><p>Upon hearing she would have to wear a swim cap to help heal her injury, the player also revealed her reaction was, "No, I really don't want that." Although, can we just opine that she really pulled off the look that was so embarrassing to her?</p><p>Meanwhile, this unconventional piece of equipment has clearly been used before in similar situations.</p><p>Indeed as the medical staff of NJ/NY Gotham FC, a team in the National Women's Soccer League, told Today, "The compression provided by the swim cap helps stop the bleeding and also prevents blood from getting on the player‚Äôs jersey."</p><p>The statement went on to explain, "If blood appears on a player‚Äôs jersey, the player is temporarily removed from the match and required to change into a clean jersey before returning to play."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZKynk5iys3nPpZiynaKoerixwKtkm6qRqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-candice-murley-tiktok.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Happened to Popular TikTok Creator Candice Murley Marystown?</span></a>
