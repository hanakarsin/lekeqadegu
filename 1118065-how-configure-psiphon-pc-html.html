It is a tool that uses VPN, HTTP Proxy and SSH for Internet censorship circumvention. Or, to simply put it, it’s a tool that helps you to access banned or blocked websites through a tunneling system.</p><p class=align-left>Psiphon inc. actively supports the idea of "freedom of information". They are willing to help the users in countries that are considered to be "enemies of the Internet". Psiphon inc. claims that "Our continued mission is to be the first recourse against censorship wherever and whenever it occurs". Way to go, Psiphon!</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03629bce603d6be6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>After 3 months what will now happen? - Nigerians react as Keyamo speaks on FG's menial job programme</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Psiphon is an open-source project, which means that you can change the source code, study it and even distribute the software to basically anyone you want.</p><p class=align-left>There are several open source software projects that are related to each other and are the part of Psiphon:</p><p class=align-left>- Psiphon 1.X - The home based server software that was released in 2004 by the developers (Citizen Lab). Today, however, the Psiphon 1.X is not supported by Citizen Lab or Psiphon Inc.</p><p class=align-left>- 2.X - A secure proxy system that is cloud-based;</p><p class=align-left>- 3.X - The most recent version out of the three (the initial release was in 2011). 3.X is also cloud-based, but this time it’s a run-time tunneling system. Sometimes it is called Psiphon for PC.</p><p class=align-left>Interesting fact - originally the concept for Psiphon was developed at the University of Toronto by the Citizen Lab, in the late 2004. A few years later, the Psiphon Inc. was established.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16d02205196670b9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Young boy from southeast builds power plant in his community, invites people to charge phones, other gadgets (photos)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Psiphon supports most operating systems - Windows, IOS, and Android.

The process is not complicated (to be honest, it is really very easy), you just need to follow the instructions below.</p><p class=align-left>1. Go to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official site</a> and find the big Download button. Click it!</p><p class=align-left>2. You will see a page divided into several sections - App Store Downloads, Direct Downloads, and Download via Email. Since we are setting up Psiphon on PC, click on the “Psiphon for Windows” in the Direct Downloads section.</p><p class=align-left>3. The download will start automatically. You will get a file “psiphon3.exe”. Find it in your “Downloads” folder or the other folder that you use for your download files.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4v1fggn0j5k.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where can you get SAP training in Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>4. Double click on the file to start the connection process. It will take a few seconds.</p><p class=align-left>5. Congratulations, you are connected! Now you can use it on daily basis and check out the settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16d02205196670b9.jpg><p class=align-left>But how to use Psiphon? It's very easy. You just need to launch the “psiphon3.exe” every time you need to visit a banned website. It will connect automatically via the fastest country (or the country of your choice). There's not much too it, really.</p><p class=align-left>The connection in Psiphon is via the fastest country by default, but you can change it. Just click on the bar at the bottom of the main screen in the Psiphon 3 app, and you will see the drop-down menu with the countries that are available.</p><p class=align-left>Important note: If you know somebody who can't use the home website of Psiphon because it's either banned or blocked, then you can share with them the email, that you will find in the “Download via Email” section. Then they can request for the download file via email.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3eafn444bsfg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Useful guide on how to download NOUN courseware for School of science and technology</span></p></a><h2>How to configure Psiphon on PC?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3qd760gj3ue.jpg><p class=align-left>There are several settings that you can configure to your preference right in the app. You can:</p><p class=align-left>- Minimize the app to the notification area. Quite helpful when you need to free up the space on the taskbar.</p><p class=align-left>- You can manually configure the HTTP/HTTPS and SOCKS if needed. However, it is recommended to leave it to Psiphon to select the ports automatically. You can also change the Hostname and Port if certain proxies are required.</p><p class=align-left>- Split the tunnel, so websites from your home country (in our case Nigeria) won’t be tunneled through the app. This will give you faster access to the “home country” sites.</p><p class=align-left>- You can also disable timeouts which is a great option for those who are suffering from slow networks. The Psiphon server won't time out, so it is less likely to experience disconnections.</p><p class=align-left>- The last thing you can do is to use the L2TP/IPSec. It means that the app will use the Windows L2TP/IPSec virtual networking. It will tunnel the apps that you are using, however it hard to bypass most firewalls, so it is not recommended to use this mode.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyttgdb6isl79k.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 5 foreign companies looking for distributors in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Why does government block or ban certain websites?
