We have reached where we must celebrate one of the greatest legacies. It is a time to celebrate Mama because of her great deeds. The life of Grace Akeredolu is a life worthy of celebration.</p><p>“She lost her husband at the age of 50 and lived up to 90. She brought up her children. She made a great effort at raising four boys.</p><p>“She did very well indeed. We must thank God because not only did she bring up her children well but all of them are successful.</p><p>“What we must celebrate most is her service to God and mankind. We celebrate the life of a great woman; a woman who served God well and her community.”</p><p>Tinubu in his remark said “Thank God we are alive. There might be weaknesses and inadequacies in expectations. No one wants failure. You cannot give up on us. We will do better.</p><p>“We will contribute to the improvement you might want. Mama has given us the grace of the day that she will not be the one to bury us. She had the greatest legacy of a life full of achievements.”</p><p>Naija News also learnt that the Anglican Bishop of Owo Diocese, Stephen Fagbemi, in his sermon told politicians to include hospital tours in their campaign activities.</p><p>Fagbemi, urged Akeredolu and his siblings to immortalise their mother because she lived a life of service to God and humanity.</p><p>He said, “Go to hospitals and schools and see what Nigeria is like. I encourage you to go to FMC here in Owo to campaign and see what the future holds. The poor are getting poorer. Nigeria needs a change that will ensure safety and security in villages.</p><p>“We need a government that understands the economy. Life is hard in this country. Let our leaders be careful to help us move things forward. The best place to start the campaign is in the hospital.”</p><p>Akeredolu, while responding to Fagbemi said “We have listened to your sermon. It was wonderful listening to the sermon. I will not contend with you but I know as politicians, we are doing our best. It might not be good for everybody.</p><p>“You should also say the things we have done. Continue to pray for us so that we will do our best. We will look at it. It is not that we are not trying. We have our shortcomings.</p><p>“We have crops of politicians in the South-West that we can be very proud of. Not all of us shall die. We shall be here when Christ shall come.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BrZqirmaOvorbOZquipqWXwm672J6rqKSRYrqqucikpmanpJ2ys3nDop6noaSWv6qx0maqraeionqww85mnaiqXZa4pr7EnaalrV2ivLW0xKuqZpqlp7aiuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./independence-day-stop-the-war-now-ganduje-tells-northern-southern-govs.html><span>←</span><span>Independence Day: 'Stop The War Now'</span></a>
