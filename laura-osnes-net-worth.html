So, what exactly is her net worth in 2021, and for what other reasons has the star been making headlines as of late?

She has made quite a bit of money working on Broadway.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Laura has amassed a substantial fortune thanks to her numerous roles on hit Broadway productions. As of 2021, her reported net worth is roughly $2 million, a sum that is attributed not only to her work on stage, but also to several films, television shows, and a variety of endorsement deals throughout the years.</p><p>Beyond her work on Grease, Laura also starred as Nellie Forbush in South Pacific and Hope Harcourt in Anything Goes.

Indeed, reports have emerged that Laura was fired from a Hampton's stage production after admitting that she did not receive either vaccine jab and doesn't plan to do so because she does not trust the science behind it.</p><p>Broadway productions fall under the recent New York City mandates that require attendees and performers to be vaccinated.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, Laura's co-star, Tony Yazbeck, pressed her to reconsider getting the vaccine because "he has two little kids at home" that he wants to protect. Nonetheless, Laura has remained strong in her conviction, and as a result, she was fired from her leading role in the production.</p><p>She was reportedly quickly replaced by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sierra Boggess</a>, who famously starred as Ariel in the hit Broadway adaptation of The Little Mermaid.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Laura Osnes (@lauraosnes)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Laura Osnes a Republican? She has spoken about her values and beliefs in the past.</h2><p>According to that same report from Page Six, it appears that Laura has previously identified herself as a "Christian conservative," although no further clarification on her political stance beyond that was given.</p><p>There are also rumors that a since-deleted video circulating on social media of a rally held in former president Donald Trump's honor showed Laura in attendance, but these claims haven't been verified.</p><p>Despite the questions emerging about her political stance and the lack of confirmation from Laura on the matter, it appears that she is cordial with both Democrats and Republicans. The star notably headlined in this year's Capitol Fourth of July celebration in Washington, D.C. Furthermore, Laura performed in the same show in the year prior under Trump's administration.</p><p>"I relish any opportunity to honor our country," said the actress when asked about taking the job in 2021, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Boston Herald</a>.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading COVID-19 is to </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>get vaccinated</strong></a><strong>. </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>, and wearing a mask or cloth facial covering are also extremely important.
