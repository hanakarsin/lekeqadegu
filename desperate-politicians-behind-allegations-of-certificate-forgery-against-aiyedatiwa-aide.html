The first of such is to use faceless groups and individuals to make allegations of certificate forgery against the governor.</p><p>“A governorship aspirant last night held a meeting with some individuals at a popular hotel in Akure where he gave the directive to those present to write stories alleging that the governor used forged certificates to contest election.”</p><p>Adeniyan added that the allegation was part of the plot allegedly aimed at discrediting the governor ahead of the governorship election in the state, saying the credentials of the governor were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission during the last governorship election in the state.</p><p>“Mr Governor contested on a joint ticket with his former principal in the 2020 governorship election, and his credentials were duly submitted to the INEC, and they are in the public domain.</p><p>“Mr Governor remains committed to delivering on his promises to develop Ondo State and will not be distracted by the shenanigans of shameless politicians and their cronies, he submitted.”</p><p>Aiyedatiwa, who assumed the governorship following Akeredolu’s demise, has pledged to persist in and conclude all ongoing projects initiated throughout the state by his predecessor.</p><p>Prior to his passing, Akeredolu officially delegated authority to Aiyedatiwa through a letter to the state House of Assembly on December 13, 2023, as he prepared to take a medical leave in Germany.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49xZp2do6Wys63TnmSpp5yewaqvyJqlrGWSmrWqusNmmKWklZyutbXOp6pmp5ZisKa%2B06KdopuRqbJuss6rnp6qqWKuqK3Ip6qtZZGexqawwK2gsJldlralsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-trex-the-masked-singer.html><span>←</span><span>'The Masked Singer's T-Rex Is THIS 16-Year-Old Celeb (SPOILERS)</span></a>
