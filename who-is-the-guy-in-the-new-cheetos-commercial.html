"My music has traveled far around the world and 100 percent in Spanish with my Puerto Rican slang. Wherever I go, in every interview, I let everyone know that I am Latino and Puerto Rican and I think that I have left that mark well placed in the whole world."</p><p>Now, fans who had spotted the "Yo Perreo Sola" artist filming in Los Angeles' Boyle Heights neighborhood are getting to see the first fruits of his labor and new collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>In keeping with Bad Bunny's aim to leave his mark on music and society more generally, Cheetos also announced that they would team up with Benito's Good Bunny Foundation to give back half a million dollars to the Latinx community.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bad Bunny's Good Bunny Foundation has been hard at work.</h2><p>Multi-platinum international sensation Bad Bunny launched his Good Bunny Foundation "to improve the quality of life of Puerto Rican youth through the support of youth arts and sports initiatives, in collaboration with other non-profit organizations."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@sanbenito</a> is in BH <a href=#>#BadBunny</a> <a href=#>#BoyleHeights</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/81lGwwohib</a></p>— Alessandro Negrete (@les_beat_junky) <a href=#>October 23, 2020</a></figure><p>So far, in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Bunny Foundation</a> organized the first annual "La Nueva Tradición" event, in which 30,000 Puerto Rican children received gifts of toys and musical instruments. The foundation went on to focus on the "Play Ball Again" initiative to restore Little League baseball fields around Puerto Rico.</p><p>And most recently, in November 2020, Bad Bunny's foundation pledged a $1 million contribution to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp, which was founded "to support the advancement of Black and Brown communities while addressing racial inequality and police brutality."</p><p>The multi-year million-dollar contribution will further Know Your Rights Camp's reach to Latinx youth and will "allow for the expansion of the Legal Defense Initiative, as well as KYRC's digital platforms that allow closer connection with youth in the wake of COVID-19."</p><p>Considering his altruistic tendencies, Bad Bunny's latest Deja Tu Huella collaboration with Cheetos makes a great deal of sense, and we can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZK2glWK0tsWMoqVmrJiaeq%2Bx1maaoZ2Vqby0ecKopKadopi2org%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zoe-saldana-html.html><span>←</span><span>Zoe Saldaa - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
