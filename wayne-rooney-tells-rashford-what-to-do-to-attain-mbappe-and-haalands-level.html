Haaland also helped Manchester City to win the treble – the Premier League title, UEFA Champions League, and the FA Cup for the first time in the history of the club and the first time in England since United did it in 1999."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I’m delighted he’s signed a new deal. The next five years for him are going to be really important in his legacy because he can score a lot of goals, but if he really wants to go to that level which Mbappe and Haaland are at then he has to be the man to get Manchester United back to winning trophies and league titles. I hope he can do that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5ByZrCZqaOybr7OqKWesV2psq240mapmquYm7yzsIywn5qsXam8brDOZquoZZGpwaK1zWakm5mgpbJurc2dZKGZkaGur7DSZqOerpWhfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-cooper-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Cooper - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
