Waiting in traffic as you watch the seconds of your life slip away is one of them.</p><p>Recently, a pregnant woman made <a href=#>headlines</a> combating this frustration ‚Äî&nbsp;and also making a larger point ‚Äî by using the HOV lane.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The pregnant woman's reasoning for using the HOV lane is what has so many people talking.</h2><p>Being stuck in your vehicle as you stare into the abyss during a 50-minute commute that should only take you 15 minutes is infuriating. So it's understandable (although not legal nor encouraged) that some folks skirt the rules of the road in order to try and minimize the amount of time they're sitting idle on the road.</p><p>Sometimes, they might even use a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane when they're technically not supposed to. Generally speaking, HOV lanes are reserved for vehicles with more than one occupant.</p><p>However, Brandy Bottone ‚Äî who is pregnant ‚Äî may have found a loophole thanks to Texas's penal code and the Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p><p>Brandy was driving by herself in the HOV lane when she was pulled over and ticketed. However, she argued that she shouldn't be ticketed for using the carpool lane as, according to state law, she was rolling along the road with a baby on board who counts as a second person (according to Texas law).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, 34-year-old Brandy Bottone says that she intends to fight the ticket in court. Brandy was headed to pick up her 6-year-old son when she was pulled over in the HOV lane. She said that the officer "brushed [her] off" when she brought up the fact that she had a child inside of her body and referenced Roe v. Wade being overturned, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallas Morning News</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandy Bottone is my hero.</p><p>She is the pregnant TX woman who drove in the HOV lane and was ticketed.</p><p>Her defense: ‚ÄúMy baby girl is right here.

Wishing now I had gone to law school & could represent you in court. This is going to be interesting. More lawsuits will come as woman will demand child support & tax deductions from day one of conception in addition to carrying unborn child in HOV lane. <a href=#>https://t.co/waIMQGjqCJ</a></p>‚Äî Linda Paul (@LoverlyLinda) <a href=#>July 9, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @LoverlyLinda</span></figure><p>"Not trying to make a political stance here, but you understand that this is a baby. It's 34 weeks along, and for sure, she's kicking and it's real life," Brandy remarked.</p><p>The mom was fined $275 by the officer, but says she was told by the deputy that the citation would "probably get dismissed" anyway. "I was like, wait, you're telling me that you just wrote me a ticket for an HOV citation, and you're telling me that I can get it dismissed, but now ... I have to go to the courthouse, go fight it? And it's just, now you're wasting my time."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandy Bottone of Plano never expected her challenge of an HOV ticket to go viral. Argues her unborn child counts as a passenger in light of recent events about reproductive rights. She's staying neutral politically. "If there's a pro-women category, that's my stance." <a href=#>@wfaa</a> <a href=#>@10</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/M7goosEfEa</a></p>‚Äî Jobin Panicker (@jobinpnews) <a href=#>July 11, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @jobinpnews</span></figure><p>As for what was going through her mind when she decided to take the HOV lane, Brandy added, "I see this as two people. The signs, if you drive downtown ... says 'HOV (2).' And I was like one, two, we're checkmarked. We're good. And I guess it just didn't fly that day." She went on to say that she feels safer driving in the carpool lane during heavy traffic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúOne law is saying that this is a baby and now he‚Äôs telling me this baby that‚Äôs jabbing my ribs is not a baby,‚Äù said Brandy Bottone, 32. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt it all make sense?‚Äù<a href=#>https://t.co/yyoIXh2vyU</a></p>‚Äî TribLIVE.com (@TribLIVE) <a href=#>July 11, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @TribLIVE</span></figure><p>The mom told CBS that she'd previously driven in the HOV lane while pregnant in the past with her two other children but that this was the first time she'd ever been pulled over for doing so.</p><p>She also intends on fighting the ticket in court, as long as her child doesn't make her arrival in the meantime.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandy Bottone says her fetus is considered a human being. She tells this to sheriff‚Äôs deputies giving HOV lane violation tickets. Them: So sad, too bad. Her: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right.
