This is why he completely mismanaged our national affairs and turned our nation into the poverty capital of the world and the third country with the highest level of terrorism according to the World Terrorism Index.</p><p>“Such arrogance of power is manifesting in President Buhari and APC’s refusal to accept failure for the near collapse of our economy from the $550 billion economy (largest in Africa and 26th globally) handed over to them in 2015 by the PDP; the fall of the naira from about N197 to a dollar to almost N600 today and the hike in petrol price from N87 per liter in 2015 to between N300 andN400 per liter today.</p><p>“In addition to this, the price of diesel which is a critical component in the productive sector of the economy now stands at inconceivable N700 per liter under the APC.</p><p>“Is it not arrogance of power that informed the Buhari-led APC administration to import contaminated fuel, induce agonizing fuel scarcity on our citizens and yet had the effrontery to tell Nigerians that “heaven will not fall” over the fuel situation?</p><p>“The same arrogance of power accounted for the repeated refusal by the APC administration to obey Court Orders; for President Buhari’s repeated refusal to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill until he was pressured by the PDP and Nigerians as well as his constant disdain toward the people in repeatedly refusing to address the nation on critical issues, notably during the October 2020 EndSARS protest and the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>“The arrogance and impunity of the APC administration also accounted for its refusal to prosecute APC leaders indicted for corruption; the barefaced denial that no one was killed in the EndSARS protest despite national and international evidence of bloody massacre of our youths at the Lekki Tollgate as well as the failure to account for the billions of naira Covid-19 Funds stolen by APC leaders.</p><p>“This is in addition to the recent arrogant, corrupt and criminal removal of electricity subsidy without reference to Nigerians among other thoughtless and inhumane actions of the APC government.</p><p>“Moreover, it is ludicrous that Mr. President who confirmed that the APC as a party of irreconcilable political warlords, is bedeviled by “the infighting we are seeing” instead of the expected “robust debate on the issues that matter”, is looking elsewhere for a lesson in “disunity, mismanagement and corruption”.</p><p>“Mr. President has so arrogantly mismanaged the APC that it is now plagued by two illegal national chairmen, multiple structures in States; enfeebled to the extent that it cannot conduct a valid National Convention or produce legitimate candidates for elections, with its activities no longer recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p><p>“Since President Buhari has now agreed that government should not be “a vehicle for self-aggrandizement to be held at all costs” the PDP urges him to assist his party to wind up as Nigerians are now rallying on the platform of the united, cohesive, focused and dependable PDP in our mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the arrogance and misrule of the Buhari APC government.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BsZputmJa%2FqnnAnaSippmowbOt06Kmp2WZqHqiecKeqa2hlp6ypXnFmqClraKaerGwz2adoqqVqHqxvsSsoJ2dnql6orzCaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./life-below-zero-northern-territories-cast.html><span>←</span><span>'Life Before Zero: Northern Territories': The Cast 4-1-1</span></a>
