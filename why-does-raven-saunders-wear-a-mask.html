People can't help but notice that Raven wears a mask while they compete, but because these Olympic Games aren't during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has left many wondering why Raven Saunders wears a mask at the Olympics.</p><p>Raven isn't the only one with what appears to be a tradition during the Olympics. Other athletes wear <a href=#>athletic arm sleeves</a>, for example, or something else to make them feel prepared for the competition. And when you've been in multiple Games, like Raven, it's only natural that it becomes a whole thing for you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@giveme1shot__</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does Raven Saunders wear a mask at the 2024 Summer Olympics?</h2><p>For Raven, the trend of wearing a mask with a fun design came about during the pandemic. When they competed in the 2021 Olympics, Raven got used to wearing a mask. But they wanted it to feel fun, rather than a potential hindrance on their performance as a shot putter.</p><p>In August 2021, Raven spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! Sports</a> about their mask which, at the time, had a wide toothy grin of the superhero the Hulk on it. For Raven, having to wear a mask meant expressing themselves through it too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by jeffcohenphoto (@jeffcohenphoto)</a></p></figure><p>"Early on, similar to the Hulk, I had a tough time differentiating between the two," Raven shared with the outlet. "I had a tough time controlling when the Hulk came out or when the Hulk didn’t come out. But through my journey, especially dealing with mental health and things like that, I learned how to compartmentalize, the same way that Bruce Banner learned to control the Hulk."</p><p>Now, Raven continues to wear a mask out of self-expression and because they have become known for wearing fun masks during the Olympics. While masks are not mandatory for Olympic athletes now, Raven still wears one when they compete.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@giveme1shot__</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Raven Saunders dating anyone?</h2><p>There's no doubt that Raven has garnered the attention from those who watch the Olympics for their talent at shot put, but also for the many different masks they wear. But have they also gained the attention of someone romantically? Raven hasn't shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> if they're dating anyone right now.</p><p>However, they might just prefer to keep some things private, since they are a public figure and Olympic athlete. And for what it's worth, Raven might be too busy for romance at the moment. Between their frequent training sessions and time spent with friends, there might be little time right now for dating. But that just means Raven has more time in their schedule to make sure they take home the gold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlopbDprqMrJiuppSav7R51p6Yq2WRYrqiv8o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tinubu-hosts-olugbon-of-orile-igbon-in-aso-rock-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Tinubu Hosts Olugbon Of Orile-Igbon In Aso Rock (Photos)</span></a>
