Just smile, say hello, introduce yourself, and ask for her name.</li><li><strong>Ask her about her day - </strong>You can strike up a conversation by asking what her day was like and prompting her to speak about it. This is a great way to show her that you are interested in her everyday life.</li><li><strong>Break the ice - </strong>Try to focus on something you have in common and then ask her about it. For instance, strike up an exchange about the class you both take, or some common hobby you have.</li><li><strong>Compliment her - </strong>A genuine compliment would flatter her. Try to make it meaningful and appropriate - for instance, you could compliment her smile, outfit, or necklace.</li><li><strong>Try a pickup line - </strong>This one is tricky - try to be creative instead of using something cheesy or crude. Confidence is one of the main keys to a pickup line's successful delivery.</li><li><strong>Focus on non-verbal cues - </strong>You should mind your body language. Smiling and maintaining eye contact would signify your openness while looking down and grumpily crossing your arms would come across as uninviting.</li><li><strong>Start talking about the weather - </strong>At first, it may seem a little boring, as the weather topic is not exactly deep and thought-provoking. However, there is a chance that something more could grow from it.</li><li><strong>Talk about pop culture - </strong>Everyone has favourite movies, TV shows, music, and books. Perhaps, you can find out more about what she prefers, and then see whether it aligns with your interests.</li><li><strong>Mention an event - </strong>Life is full of events, and it is possible that your paths may cross during some of them. It can be anything, starting with exams you are both taking, and ending with a holiday or a festival that you are planning to go to.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dc07c2c3b5a65ac6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to talk to girls: these useful tips will improve your communication skills</span></p></a><h2>Best conversation starters</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some amazing conversation starters for teens and adults that can serve as a good way to spark a friendship.</p><p class=align-left>These interesting conversation starters will help you learn some exciting information about the person and bond with them more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e0fd25026f3d9dbf.jpg><ul><li>What made you laugh today?</li><li>Where do you see yourself in five years?</li><li>What would your ideal life look like?</li><li>What is your idea of the perfect day?</li><li>Who has been the most influential person in your life and why?</li><li>What does success mean to you?</li><li>What motivates you most in life?</li><li>What is a significant event that has changed you?</li><li>Is there a dream you’ve always had?</li><li>What are you most passionate about?</li><li>What was your favorite thing to do as a kid?</li><li>What’s your favorite TV show?</li><li>What do you like to cook the most?</li><li>Do you have any nicknames?</li><li>What did you want to be growing up?</li><li>What’s your dream job?</li><li>How do you spend your mornings?</li><li>What is your favorite weekend activity?</li><li>Do you have any pet peeves?</li><li>Are you a cat person or a dog person?</li><li>What are three fun facts about yourself?</li><li>What time period would you travel to?</li><li>What is your earliest memory?</li><li>What is one thing you can’t live without?</li><li>What instrument would you like to play?</li><li>What three things are you most grateful for?</li><li>What is your least favorite chore?</li><li>If you could be an animal, what would it be and why?</li><li>When is the last time you laughed so hard that you cried?</li><li>What makes you the happiest?</li><li>If you could sit down with your 13-year old self, what would you say?</li><li>What’s your guilty pleasure?</li><li>What would your theme song be if you had your own show?</li><li>What would your rock band group be called?</li><li>Who’s your biggest hero?</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39f2f89071d19ef8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful and creative ways on how to ask a girl out</span></p></a><h2>How to start conversation with a girl over text</h2><p class=align-left>You got her phone number, and now everything is up to you.

Perhaps, doing it immediately is not a good idea, but it is always a good idea to strike while the iron is hot.</li><li><strong>Introduce yourself - </strong>It is always a good idea to remind her who you are if you have met briefly and she likely does not have your contact saved. This should be done to avoid the awkward "uh... who is this?".</li><li><strong>Talk consistently - </strong>Ranging from polite formal messages and "yo wassup baby" is not recommended. Otherwise, she would feel like you have a few personalities that you are switching between.</li><li><strong>Ask open-ended questions - </strong>Try to avoid yes-or-no questions, and ask some that she could give a response to. This way, you will keep the exchange alive.</li><li><strong>Make sure it is not one-sided - </strong>Do not interrogate her with questions - this will make her feel uncomfortable. Make sure that both of you have a part to play in this exchange.</li><li><strong>Do not shower her with compliments - </strong>One or two compliments would not hurt, but a million would make her feel weirded out. Be careful with this one.</li><li><strong>Do not be creepy - </strong>If you barely know her, she will probably not appreciate crude jokes or comments about her body. Any non-consensual explicit pictures are also a huge no.</li><li><strong>Use emojis, but not too many - </strong>It is okay to use some emojis to express how you feel and be a little playful. Still, do not send tons of them.</li><li><strong>Be persistent, but know where to stop - </strong>If the conversation dies down, you could take the initiative and try to spark it up again. However, sending tons of messages and pressuring her to reply when she could be busy is not great.</li><li><strong>Ask her out - </strong>After a few text exchanges and determining whether you have good chemistry, you can attempt to meet in person. Ask her to meet for coffee or drinks when you are free.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37833343c6f7bd31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to propose a girl romantically</span></p></a><h2>Text conversation starters</h2><p class=align-left>What should I text a girl to start a conversation?
