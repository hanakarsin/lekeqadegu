I was too shocked to even mention that I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years and the way I dress is for ME (but even if I was single, I could still wear wherever I want) That woman was basically saying that if I get r***d its my fault. Surely in 2024 we should all know that r**e has nothing to do with the victim and everything to do with the r****t!!!

They don't think the same way as us."</p><p>"I guess it's your generation isn't it," Emma replied, but clarified in another overlay that she regretted saying this bit: "I shouldn't have said this bc that is no excuse for what she said."</p><p>"I guess so," she says again, looking into the camera and widening her eyes. She then pantomimes screaming into the camera and pens further, "I was smiling here bc I was in shock, but that was the worst thing I've heard anyone say in my 21 years on this earth," she clarified.</p><p>At the end of her video, she takes a video of what she was wearing: a form fitting mid-thigh skirt along with a cropped cheetah print long sleeve top. She then turns to the side and protrudes her chest before going back to showing the front of her fit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ellazahra_</span></figure><p>Instead of popping off at the woman at the moment, she, in what seems to be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spirit of the staircase situation</a>, penned a lengthy caption filled with all of the things she appears to want to have said to the woman while on the train.</p><p>"There’s a lot of things that I wish I’d said to that woman that I didn’t because I was in pure shock. I honestly can’t comprehend how someone could have this mindset and say something so disgusting."</p><p>Ella went on to state that the woman's words, for a bit, did make her re-think the outfit that she put on: "For a second I did question the way I was dressed and thought could I have been more modest and then I was like f that I can dress however I want and I can’t let that woman have the power to ruin my evening."</p><p>She didn't tell the woman that she only decides to put her clothes on for herself, but it seemed that in the moment, the only shallows she was dealing with was the fact that someone thought she was dressing improperly: "I was too shocked to even mention that I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years and the way I dress is for ME (but even if I was single, I could still wear wherever I want)."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ellazahra_</span></figure><p>She went on to further detail the problem with the woman's commentary: "That woman was basically saying that if I get r***d it's my fault. Surely in 2024, we should all know that r**e has nothing to do with the victim and everything to do with the r****t!!! Please no one ever blame yourself and WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT (and be safe)."</p><p>One person applauded the way that she ended up confronting the elderly train passenger: "You confronted her sooo well... my social anxiety could never."</p><p>However, someone else said: "U were too nice ab it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ellazahra_</span></figure><p>Ella responded that she was ultimately happy about the way she handled the situation: "I’m not gonna let someone bring out an ugly side of me, no one holds that power over me, and if it did it would show the kind of person I am. I did the right thing, I got my point across without."</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=#><strong>RAINN.org</strong></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mpqdlpKeuqrqMr6CcrJmieqO4wKacrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-rickman-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alan Rickman - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
