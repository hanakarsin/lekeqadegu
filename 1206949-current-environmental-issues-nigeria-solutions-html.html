It is like a coin with two sides: one side is its exquisite environment, the other one – industrial Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>Nigeria is one of the most populous nations constantly faces different issues like overpopulation, migration, improvement of medical care as well as problems connected with environmental pollution.</p><p class=align-left>What are the main environmental problems in Nigeria?</p><li><strong>Air pollution. </strong>Daily, millions of vehicles run throughout the country: they consume plenty of fuel and produce exhaust fumes. One has to mention that the level of protection, available at the industrial giant, it does not always coincide with our expectations about the care of the environment. Old equipment and a lack of modernization contribute to the air pollution.</li><li><strong>Water pollution. </strong>It is not a secret that Nigeria has a deficit of drinking water. If you take a glance into the state of currently available water, you will be shocked by the number of bacteria and industrial chemicals.</li><li><strong>Desertification.</strong> This problem is caused by massive irrigation. The country loses kilometres of lands.</li><li><strong>Industrial waste.</strong> Social changes are the result of human migration within the country. The problem is that searching for a better life, people create difficulties with accommodation. Due to this, many residents have to settle close to the industrial areas. As a result, they have to consume water, which contains chemicals, breathe polluted air and eat food with increased nitrates.</li><li><strong>Solid waste.</strong> Nigeria is one of those countries with poor management of sanitary infrastructure. It one of the main reasons, why people live rather close to wasted areas.</li><li><strong>Oil spills.</strong> People, who inhabit the area in the delta of Niger, suffer from oil spills every year. This place is so much polluted that the oil is found in the soil, even within five meters from the surface.</li><li><strong>Deforestation.</strong> The high rate of urbanization, the industrial development, and agricultural processes led to deforestation and extinction of animals living in the woods.</li><li><strong>Wind erosion.</strong> The lands which are situated in the northern part of Nigeria are constantly being “blown away”.</li><li><strong>Climate change.</strong></li><li><strong>Soil degradation.</strong> Pesticides and chemicals often used by people for different purposes. However, they often forget about soil renovation and drawing a balance of minerals back to its original state.</li><li><strong>Floods and erosion.</strong></li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/09ffd4009c3f6289.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 simple ways you can help environment in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As you can see, problems in Nigeria and solutions should have the highest priority for governors.
