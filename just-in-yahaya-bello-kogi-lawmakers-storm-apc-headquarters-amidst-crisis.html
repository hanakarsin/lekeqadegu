Of course, we are all aware that his nominee, who was the ex-Special Adviser on Water Resources in Kogi, Yahaya Ismail was dropped in favour of Hon Duro Mesoko for the position of Deputy National Publicity Secretary.</p><p>“This same Bello was with Ganduje at his residence last night. Despite the explanation by the chairman that Mesoko was given the position to compensate Hon James Faleke for withdrawing from the Kogi governorship primary and for not making Tinubu’s ministerial list, Bello insisted that he won’t be cowed into accepting the deal.”</p><p>It was stated that the presence of Governor Bello troubled supporters of Mesoko, who sat quietly at the media centre with the embattled deputy publicity secretary-designate as many of them asked him to remain calm ahead of the swearing-in.</p><p>While the waiting continued, an emissary came to invite Mesoko for a meeting with the governor.</p><p>A few minutes after the closed-door meeting, the delegation came out of the secretariat fuming that they wouldn’t accept the deal.</p><p>One of Mesoko’s supporters speaking on the outcome of the meeting said, “Just imagine the way the governor and those lawmakers were harassing him. They wanted to know why he didn’t turn down the appointment when he was offered.</p><p>“But when Mesoko insisted that he deserved it, having worked for the party at the state level and the victory of Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu), they told him to resign immediately or risk jeopardising his political career in Kogi.</p><p>“According to them, they can all go back to Kogi for reconciliation talks if he agrees to withdraw from the deputy spokesman’s position but we told him not to be bullied into taking the decision and left.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FtZqOto6l6qrqMspihmamWeqOxy6WmZqOfnLZuuMCwpJqjlafAbr%2FTqKmmZZGlsG60xJqbqq2Rp8GmvtJmmKahlKjBbq%2FRoqqiq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-years-rockin-eve-performers.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are the 'Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve' Performers for 2022?</span></a>
