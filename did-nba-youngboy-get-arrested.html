The rumor suggests that NBA Youngboy was arrested during a music video shoot for having a gun on the set of the production. At this point, it's unclear whether the gun was used inappropriately, or whether there were issues related to the gun's permit. Many of the details around the story are still unclear.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#TSRUpdatez: We previously reported that #NBAYoungBoy was detained during during a video shoot in Baton Rouge for having a firearm.

He began releasing mixtapes in 2015, and released seven more through 2017. After that, NBA Youngboy, whose real name is Kentrell DeSean Gaulden, was signed to Atlantic Records, and released another mixtape in 2018. He's continued to steadily climb the charts in the years since he was signed.&nbsp;</p><p>Although his arrest has yet to be confirmed, this wouldn't be the first time that the rapper has faced legal troubles. In 2016, he was arrested by U.S. Marshals before a concert in Austin, Tex. At the time, he was accused of jumping out of a car and opening fire on a group of people in Baton Rouge. NBA Youngboy was eventually charged with two counts of attempted murder.&nbsp;</p><p>After he was arrested, he was incarcerated from December 2016 to August 2017 for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted first degree murder.</a> In August of that year, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault with a firearm, and took a suspended 10-year prison term and three years of probation. Since those initial charges, he's also come up against the law on several more minor charges.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Free @d.dawg38 üôèüíö</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>NBA youngboy</a> (@nbayoungboy.16x) on Sep 28, 2020 at 1:21pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What else has NBA Youngboy been arrested for?</h2><p>In 2018, there was a warrant out for NBA Youngboy's arrest in Georgia for allegedly committing assault, weapons violations, and kidnapping. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was arrested</a> in Tallahassee, footage was released that showed him assaulting someone. He was eventually released on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$75,000</a> bail, but he was incarcerated again in 2019 after he and his girlfriend were involved in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shootout in Miami.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Although he may have been arrested in Baton Rouge, NBA Youngboy currently resides in Los Angeles. Although he's only 20, the rapper has already had plenty of legal trouble, but that trouble has only been part of his story of success. His fame has only risen over the years since he dropped his first mixtape, and regardless of how frequently he's in trouble with the law, it seems like his music is speaking for itself.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalec2bmGaxn6q7qK7OsmSgnaRirrO%2BxKyrnpw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-captain-lee-sick-below-deck.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Captain Lee Rosbach Opened Up His Health Scare in 'Below Deck' Season 9</span></a>
