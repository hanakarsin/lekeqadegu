In their name he meets other leaders of the party and seeks to manipulate party decisions to suit personal vested interests that are only known to him.</p><p>“Beyond all these is also a clear case of reckless financial management of the party. With more than N30 billion realized during the sale of forms for the 2023 elections, Sen. Adamu and Sen. Omisore have embarked on spending extravaganza based on their discretionary decisions without any form of budget as required by the APC constitution,” Lukman alleged.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BvZpyqmai2tHnRqJqkq12WvaR5wKxkpa2boq6vedGep6iqpKh6orDApqxmp52ewLC%2BxGarqGWknru2rtRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-carlos-williams-html.html><span>←</span><span>William Carlos Williams - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
