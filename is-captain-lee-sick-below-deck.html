It temporarily put him on the sidelines, which threw his First Officer, Eddie Lucas, for a loop.</p><p>Captain Lee briefly explained the situation to Eddie on the phone in the Season 9 premiere.</p><p>"I have a condition," Captain Lee said. "The whole boat is your ballgame now."</p><p>While the Bravo personality did not elaborate on the nature of his "condition" at the time, he did divulge further details about his absence once he returned to My Seanna on the Nov. 1 episode.</p><p>"We have to have one of those serious-type conversations..." Captain Lee said during the "Boat Daddy" episode, before he grabbed a stack of papers for Eddie to look over. "As First Officer, you have a fiduciary responsibility to know the actual reason I was not here."</p><p>"I was in the hospital," he continued. He guided Eddie to look at a "list of issues" that he had been dealing with, which led to his hospital stay.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Eddie initially thought that Captain Lee had a heart attack, but the longtime Below Deck star said that he had an issue with his Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).</p><p>"They fixed it, and it's amazing what they can do these days," Captain Lee revealed, after confirming that it's an issue he has dealt with for years.</p><p>"I have a condition that I was born with called AFib, and it's when your heart will just randomly go into an irregular heartbeat," Captain Lee said in his interview confessional. "They hospitalized me, and they actually burn off parts of your heart that are trouble spots."</p><p>Though the yacht star was feeling good following his serious health matter, he noted that it did put things into perspective for him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Captain Lee's temporary 'Below Deck 'replacement, Sean Meagher?</h2><p>While the longtime Below Deck personality was dealing with his "condition," Captain Sean Meagher stepped in to lead the crew.</p><p>Though Captain Lee's replacement was new to the Below Deck world, he was quite familiar with the My Seanna boat. When the cameras weren't rolling on Seasons 8 or 9, Sean worked as the main captain for the vessel.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Laurent Bassett / Bravo</span></figure><p>In addition to being a captain, Sean is also a yacht and charter broker (he even worked on the sale of My Seanna in 2021).</p><p>The yacht captain hails from Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>New episodes of Below Deck Season 9 air on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.
