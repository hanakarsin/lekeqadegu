The reality series also chronicles the medium's relationship with his girlfriend, former Miss Rhode Island, <a href=#>Alexa Papigiotis</a>, as well as what she calls Matt's own "crazy Italian family."</p><p>But many viewers are convinced that <a href=#>Matt Fraser is gay</a>... Is there any truth to those rumors? Keep reading while we investigate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wait, is Matt Fraser from 'Meet the Frasers' gay?</h2><p>Viewers of Matt's new show seem to be absolutely taken by the medium and his boisterous family, though they wish they could see more of the supernatural side to this funny family. "Your sense of humor is hilarious," one fan jumped on Twitter to say. "Sad that there wasn't many readings, after all that's what you do, right? But will def be tuning in for more Fraser antics next week."</p><p>"I love you and I love your family, you are all very funny and wonderful people," added another. Another fan called Meet the Frasers "the only reason to look forward to Monday!"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Thank you all for the amazing Birthday wishes.

In fact, fans can't contain themselves when it comes to speculating about Matt's sexuality. "I'm no psychic but I'm getting a message from spirits that Matt is mega GAY," wrote one.</p><p>"Alexa seems to be the only person who can't see Matt is gay," added another, noting that Alexa has been quite preoccupied with setting up her wedding — an event Matt hasn't quite thought all the way through. "Love how her bridesmaids dresses and whole wedding enchilada is out for wedding season and he's like I'll propose when I want to," opined one viewer.</p><p>Some people on Twitter were committed to spelling it out for Alexa. "How do these people to see it, if only from the clothes he wears [sic]," one began, noting that "of course he's not going to ask that girl to marry him."</p><p>We obviously can't confirm Matt's sexuality one way or another, but hope that he feels free to be and love whoever he wants, regardless of their gender and presentation.&nbsp;But hey, if being with Alexa fulfills him and makes him happy, we are stanning that -ship as well!</p><p>In the wise words of @shanecdotes_, a tweet that Matt himself even favorited and replied "Amen" to: "I really wish the people on Twitter that are inappropriately preoccupied with Matt's sexuality would stick to the show! You're all acting like bullies it's really gross!"</p><p>New episodes of Meet the Frasers air Mondays at 10 p.m. on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucCtq2aeopbApr6MoJiy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./62761-html.html><span>←</span><span>Two Cattle Rustlers Arrested In Bauchi</span></a>
