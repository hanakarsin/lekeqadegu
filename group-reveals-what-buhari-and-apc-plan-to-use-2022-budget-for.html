This is the highlight of the uninspiring speech of the President as it cannot add any productive value to the economy.</p><p>“Furthermore, a close look at the speech will show Nigerians that President Buhari has been perpetually funding the same set of projects without ever completing them.</p><p>“After borrowing over N33trillion, President Buhari is still declaring to Nigerians that he is borrowing to fund Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano Expressway, East-West Road, 2nd Niger Bridge, etc.</p><p>“Nigerians should please ask President Buhari; when will these projects, which have been in the budgets since 2016, be completed?</p><p>“They quickly approved the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, they quickly approved the 2021 supplementary budget; they quickly approved loans and all borrowings and also will quickly approve this budget.</p><p>“All these were without critical analysis on the impact of their approvals on the people they represent. Nigerians are hereby called upon to bear yet again another year of suffering but have hope that when the opposition takes over, Nigeria will get back on its feet.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that the Ministry of Finance, Zainab Ahmed said that internal revenue was not enough for the country to function and the country could only retain it’s functional position if borrowed funds were poured into the economy.</p><p>Buhari has also said that the money borrowed will help in lifting the country from recession.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49xZqCqn6q9br7Er5yapKNixKmt02aZrqCRp7Zurc2dZJqok2K9ra3NZquoZaWosm5%2Bj2tpZpqlmbSmwIyfpqtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-kind-cancer-does-beth-chapman-have.html><span>←</span><span>Beth Chapman Passes Away After Long Battle With Throat Cancer</span></a>
