I’m further directed to inform you, that your concerns have been duly noted by the Nigerian Army.</p><p>“However, the NA hasn’t violated any constitutional provisions on torture. It’s important to point out that the NA, in line with the Constitution, can perform certain roles such as arrest and investigation, if it’s in defence of the welfare of the entire citizenry. In that light and taking into consideration the nature of the security situation in the country, the actions of Chiwetalu Agu adorning himself with the flag of a proscribed group is capable of sparking controversies that could endanger safety and security loss of lives and property. It’s pertinent to be reminded about the many atrocities committed by this proscribed group in recent times, such as the unwarranted and selective attacks on security personnel and facilities as well as the Sit at Home Order which its leaders have constantly initiated.</p><p>“Deriving from this narrative, it must be unambiguously stated that there is no law that restricts the NA in circumstances of a security breach, from arresting a suspect and conducting investigations and thereafter releasing or handing over such suspect to the Nigeria Police for further investigation where necessary. In this case, Chiwetalu Agu was arrested, investigated and subsequently released. The NA is a respecter of human rights and due process and would never succumb to any form of impunity.</p><p>“Please accept the esteemed regards of the best wishes of the Chief of Army Staff.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49uZqehl5q%2Fqq3NZpirpalitKrCxKxkq52RqLyvecWoqWaZoqeytMDIp55mnJWprqq6yKeeZpuYnsSmwMClrGaZl6p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corey-davis-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Corey Davis' Brother Titus Davis Dies of Kidney Cancer</span></a>
