You have to plan the summer vacation while still going to work and staying on top of your kids to make sure they're not destroying the house while you're away.</p><p>But that doesn't mean you can't have a little fun, which is why you planned for a family getaway out of town so you can enjoy a new city, some new sites, new food and hopefully new and happy experiences.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: nbc</a></figure><p>Like all good things in life, however, your summer vacation will ultimately be tested. Things will come and try to ruin your fun and it's up to you to react to them accordingly and do whatever is possible to make sure that you and your family and friends end up having an amazing time.</p><p>Even if you manage to get a see-through bathroom.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Stayed at a hotel with an interesting addition in each room.

We laughed, dad didn’t.</p>— Big Joe (@BIGJOEONTHEGO) <a href=#>June 19, 2018</a></figure><p>Because we're constantly thinking about what to do next and are juggling so many different requests in our heads simultaneously during a vacation, it's easy to let a few things go unnoticed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When I was a kid my family went to Disney World and my parents thought they lost my sister so, of course, they start freaking out, calling her name, and scaring everyone around us, only to realize that she was sitting on my dad’s shoulders the whole time <a href=#>#SummerVacationFail</a></p>— Mollie LaFavers (@mklafavers) <a href=#>June 19, 2018</a></figure><p>Flying can get a big expensive, so packing into a huge old station wagon that's prone to overheating is an American family tradition.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Almost every summer vacation in the 80s. 9 kids, 1 overheated wagon, and 0 shirts on my dad. <a href=#>#SummerVacationFail</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TeLD7WJ0UW</a></p>— Chrissy Staresinic (@chrissystarz) <a href=#>June 20, 2018</a></figure><p>This next story is why you should always bring a spare...of anything that's vital.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We saved up as a family for 10 years to go to Disney.
