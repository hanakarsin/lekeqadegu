He specifically directed them to ensure they eliminate anybody suspected to be a Biafran agitator or IPOB member, and not to bother bringing them to police stations anymore.</p><p>“There are so many security challenges in the North where the rampaging Boko Haram terrorists and bandits have seized the control of many communities and the local government areas, yet there is no shoot-on-sight order declared by the double-faced Buhari-led Federal Government. South-East and South-South are not at war with anybody but Fulani terrorists supported by the Nigerian government brought war into our land, killing innocent people while pointing accusing fingers at IPOB members and ESN operatives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FrZqKon5d6s7HAnKusZZGoeq61y6KrmqqpYr%2Bmv9SmnKxlkZ6%2FtMDRoqKeq12eu261zKhm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giu-hellsing-html.html><span>←</span><span>Giu Hellsing - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
