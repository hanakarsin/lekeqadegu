Specifically, $1.13 billion was imported in the first quarter, $1.03 billion in the second quarter, and $654.65 million in the third quarter of 2023, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands.</p><p>Daily Trust quoted BudgIT’s lead researcher, <strong>Orji Uche,</strong> to have revealed that only 19 states could fund their expenditure with internally generated revenue and federal allocation.</p><p>She cautioned state governments against persisting in their dependence on federal allocations, particularly given the prevailing uncertainties surrounding the oil market.</p><p>“And by sustaining themselves, we are looking only at the recurrent expenditure. Are you going to meet your operating obligations, are you able to pay salaries so that anything coming from federal allocation would go to investments in the key sectors of the economy,” Uche said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49rZp%2BtnKF6rbXSrWSfm6Ris6rCxGamraCVp3q0wMCtnKxlopqwsL7DZm1ubF1rgm65yKWjoqeeYravecWoqZ6hl6N6qrrVnqqtpZWjwbR51qKroaGeYsGpvsSeZKannqm1tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boko-haram-buhari-issues-directive-to-defence-hq-over-killings-in-niger-state.html><span>←</span><span>Buhari Issues Directive To Defence HQ Over Killings In Niger State</span></a>
