He said the people will change their direction when the fortune of the region gets better.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Ex President Obasanjo Gives Further Comments On Biafra</p><p>He said: <i>“I sympathise with people agitating in the country, but what Nigeria needs to do now is to get our economy back on track. When you have a bad economic situation, such is expected. So I did not see their cause as a threat but I see it as a platform to get their voices heard.</i></p><p><i>“Like I said on January 15, the important, authentic leaders of the South-East are concerned about economic situation of Nigeria and I believe when the situation changes tomorrow, these young people will sing a new song.”</i></p><p>Chief Obasanjo said he had no regrets facilitating the emergence of Goodluck Jonathan as he was able to make a member of the minority rule the country.</p><p>He said<i>: “I believe that Nigeria politics will be strengthened even more if we have the opportunity to allow the minority in its own right to emerge as President, and I do not have any apology for anybody because the purpose I wanted Nigeria to achieve had been achieved.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Biafra War: Obasanjo Warns Nigerians Of Second Biafra War</p><p><i>“That any Nigerian can become president, it is not a regret for Nigeria and for me because Nigeria gave him that opportunity, he used, abused, misused as he wished and at the appropriate time, Nigerians said thank you for what you have done and what you have not done and Nigeria said bye bye, which is the beauty of democracy.”</i></p><p>Last year, Jonathan and Obasanjo exchanged open letters in which the former said he was interested in setting up a foundation and that will benefit Nigerians. Obasanjo replied that he gave his blessing adding that "maybe seeking how to be better and more serviceable to the nation and humanity is also a form of penitence and soul-searching to give conscience a relief and to show remorse."</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHh9kGpvZqGeqLa0wIyboJqeopZ6pbHAnWSompGorq%2B2zmaqqZ2RoMBurcaiq5qsmaS7brbOp5itoJGjwG65yKysrJ1dpby4sdFnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mothers-day-holiday-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mother's Day - Facts, Info, Trivia</span></a>
