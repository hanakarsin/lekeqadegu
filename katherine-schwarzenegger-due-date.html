Several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources confirmed the pregnancy</a> to PEOPLE. Chris and Katherine, who started dating sometime in the summer of 2018, got married this past June in Montecito, California.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple have been especially supportive of each other's careers, especially Chris Pratt, who shows endless adoration for Katherine and the recent publication of her book, The Gift of Forgiveness.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Chris and Katherine's little one will be Jack Pratt's first sibling. Seven-year-old<a href=#> Jack is Chris's son</a> with whom she shares with ex-wife Anna Faris (the two announced their separation in August 2017). Sources told PEOPLE that Chris and Katherine were "excited to expand their family as soon as possible." Looks that time is now!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's Katherine Schwarzenegger's due date?</h2><p>While we don't know how far along Katherine is, we can assume that she's been pregnant for at least three months — that's usually the time it's considered safe to start telling people. If she's three months in, that means Baby Schwarzenegger-Pratt is due sometime between October and November. If Katherine is further along, then their little one could even be born this summer, but it's not super likely, since Katherine was photographed promoting her book in mid-March and wasn't visibly showing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Since that photo was taken, neither Katherine nor Chris have posted any photos to social media that show her stomach. The couple hasn't made any public appearances lately (not that they could anyway, due to the safer-at-home mandate in Los Angeles), so we can't verify whether or not Katherine is showing. Plus, Chris and Katherine are totally entitled to their privacy about this, and will talk about it when they're ready to!</p><p>As far as motherhood goes, a source told PEOPLE that Katherine "is like a big kid and loves doing activities with Jack. She loves that Chris is a dad. Seeing Chris with Jack made Katherine positive from early on that Chris is 'the one.'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold, Katherine's dad, said he didn't push them</a> to become parents because he "[knew] it's going to happen eventually." The Terminator star stated, "It's up to Chris and her when they want to do that. I'm looking forward to it, yes."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>We're so excited for what's in store for the Schwarzenegger-Pratt family!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK61tMSroKedXaiwqcPAq7GeppWctKa%2BjJ2snmWUlsGm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./just-in-scores-killed-as-gunmen-storm-abia-cattle-market.html><span>←</span><span>Scores Killed As Gunmen Storm Abia Cattle Market</span></a>
