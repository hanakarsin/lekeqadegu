The problem is in some places, some local governments, and some parts of the states where we have this issue of banditry and Boko Haram.</p><p>“We have lost a lot of members as far as this issue is concerned. So we said the government, as a matter of urgency, should provide security to those places.&nbsp;</p><p>“Any place we see that the federal government does not provide enough security to mount those posts, we can’t just put our children and teachers in trouble.</p><p>“So that’s why we say that if security is not being provided, we will ask teachers in those areas to withdraw their services. We have made this point clear to the federal government.”</p><p>Giving a clear explanation on his claims that teachers were lost to the insecurity, Idris said: “It is not that we have lost teachers but teachers were being kidnapped together with their students because some of the teachers insisted they must go along with their students if the students were going to be taken away.</p><p>“They said if you are going to take our children, carry us all. together because we can’t just leave our students to be with you.”</p><p>Fielding questions on the commencement date for the payment of the new salary structure approved by President Muhammadu Buhari for primary and post-primary schools, he said payment of the new salary would take off next year.</p><p>“From the new salary structure for Nigerian teachers, the approval by Mr President is to commence by January 2022, so there is an effort between the Nigerian Union of Teachers, NUT, and the Federal Ministry of Education and other principal stakeholders to ensure that the implementation takes place by 2022.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49xZrCdXZ2ut7GMpaasrF1tfXF5056YnKCVp8BuwM5mmaijn2K1or7ApmSipl2ptaZ5zaipraBdmq60wIynrK1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-chandler-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Chandler - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
