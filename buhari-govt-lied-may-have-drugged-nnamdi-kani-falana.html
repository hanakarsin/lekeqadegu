He had already been kidnapped and on the way to the airport, a neighbour saw them and raised an alarm after witnessing the inhuman treatment he was subjected to.”</p><p>“In the case of Kanu, Kenyan government cannot admit that on their soil a Nigerian was taken out of the country without going through the legal process. It’s likely they drugged him to sleep and brought him back to Nigeria.”</p><p>“That is against the anti-torture act and Nigeria’s constitution. Therefore, those who say they brought Kanu back through some international collaboration are not telling the truth. Interpol cannot deport without due process.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BsZputmJa%2FqnnGqK2tZZyesqV5zJqwZqCRq7JusNGunqCdlGK7r63MnaBmo5Gjtm6ywKWYp5lf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-raven-saunders-wear-a-mask.html><span>←</span><span>Why Does Raven Saunders Wear a Mask?
