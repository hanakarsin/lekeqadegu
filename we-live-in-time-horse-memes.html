And the fact that people are talking about the We Live in Time horse and not the actual movie probably wasn't the goal here. Now, the internet has taken the image of the horse, which also has its mouth wide open as if in the middle of a horrific battle cry, and created tons of memes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The 'We Live in Time' horse memes are hard to miss.</h2><p>We Live in Time is about a couple who meet and fall in love and begin to build a life together, including starting a family. However, as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> promises, a potential terminal illness could shatter all that. Not exactly the makings of a movie with the weirdest looking horse ever on its poster, but here we are.</p><p>After the poster was released, the memes came flooding in on social media. And the tweets about the movie poster are mostly focused on that darn horse. One user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "My sympathies to Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh who will now have dozens of ugly horse memes presented to them for the entirety of the We Live in Time press run."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Are you wearing the c-"</p><p>"The carousel horse from the first look image of Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield in John Crowley‚Äôs ‚ÄòWE LIVE IN TIME‚Äô?

A24 is the production company behind We Live in Time. And for many, all they can think about is the horse, its derpy face, and the fact that the movie isn't about horses at all.</p><p>To be fair, some people didn't even know about the movie, with a release date of Oct. 11, 2024, before the movie poster went viral. Let's hope no one expects any part of it to be comedic, though, given the absolutely emotional trailer. Maybe the shining light is that we can all still laugh at that horse?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Her: You better not be Idiot Horse from the ‚ÄúWe Live In Time‚Äù poster when I get there.</p><p>Me: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ahEyktV2gf</a></p>‚Äî Cutler (@CutlerTFT) <a href=#>August 14, 2024</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe live in time‚Äù <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AGXGBA5SSk</a></p>‚Äî HappyToast‚òÖ (@IamHappyToast) <a href=#>August 14, 2024</a></figure><p>But chances are, people are going to start assuming that horses play a large role in the meet-cute, or even the story as a whole, in We Live in Time.
