He looked crazy and funny, but he is no more funny, now he is a nuisance. I used to like his style of music. That time when he first came out, I wanted him on my show. I didn’t have his phone number, so I sent him a message on Instagram.</p><p>“I requested for his contact so that we can discuss about my show. Later, I had to go through his former manager who later sent his contact to me but Portable didn’t pick up, so I went back to his manager. We did not conclude our discussion before I dropped the idea.</p><p>“Me Ke?. I have never seen him in my life. I can never shake him. He looks so dirty. He claimed I hugged him, I said me, hug ke? I have worked with his fathers in the music industry.
