They say there is one man called Secondus. They say he was dancing, celebrating that NEC gave their person a vote of confidence. He forgets history.</p><p>“Ask him, the same NEC through Aliyu Babangida, who moved a motion for vote of confidence supported by the same person, Ndude Elumelu, they gave him a vote of confidence. What happened? He left the office.</p><p>“We don’t fight and go back. If you like you can have as many as 20 votes of confidence, it is not my business. My business and my team are to make sure the right thing is done.”</p><p>“And the right thing must be done, whether today or tomorrow. So let nobody worry him or herself. If you are dancing, come home and dance. Come and mobilise for the person you think will win the election.”</p><p>“We are here, I am here waiting for him. No more 419 in this game, no more 419 in this state. We have stopped all these 419 people. Enough is enough.</p><h2>Come Home And Mobilise Support</h2><p>“You people should go home and rest. We know we are already waiting for the day set by INEC for them to blow the whistle.</p><p>“When they blow the whistle, we will know those who are in charge of Rivers State and those who are mere visitors to the state.</p><p>“You know we have those in Rivers State and those who come from Abuja. We stay here as those of us from Rivers State Monday to Sunday. Visitors come Friday and go back on Sunday,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BpZrChm5p6rrvCpKpmq5WYvK%2Bw1KxkrJmpqHqvu4yapKitnql6sLKMnKannpmZsq%2BvxGatqKyVqHq4u9Slm2arkauybq3YrmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-camacho-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Camacho - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
