I want to dedicate this day to the incredible team supporting and helping me in my journey to motherhood. While I never envisioned this to be my journey (like so many women out there), I could not be more grateful and thrilled to have such a wonderful team behind me. Thank you Dr. Brian Kaplan (the absolute best!) and the amazing women of @ovaeggfreezing for helping make my dream come true. I am truly blessed for such a unique and powerful opportunity and I hope that everyone out there who still has a dream in their heart never gives up, even when the odds seem stacked against you. My best advice? Find a new door to open and don’t hold back, give it everything you’ve got, because if you do you just might find a better story than you ever dreamed possible.
