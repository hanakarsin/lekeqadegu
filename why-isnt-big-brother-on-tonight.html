But, despite there still being plenty of <a href=#>game</a> left to play as we get down to the final two, the show doesn't air in its usual time slot on Sept. 21. So, why isn't Big Brother on tonight?</p><p>There are three episodes left until it's all over and we have a new winner crowned. And for many, that finale can't come soon enough.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why isn't 'Big Brother' on tonight?</h2><p>Season 43 of Survivor premieres on Sept. 21 at 8 p.m. EST on CBS, in Big Brother's usual Wednesday night time slot. Because the premiere is also two hours long, that means there's no room to fit in the usual Veto episode of Big Brother.</p><p>Therefore, viewers won't get a final Wednesday episode tonight. But this has happened before because of other CBS programming.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span><p>Taylor, Brittany, and Turner from 'Big Brother.'</p></figure><p>Like when the Emmys replaced the Sept. 19, 2021 episode in Season 23. So it's nothing new for CBS to have to move things around with Big Brother to accommodate other shows or specials, as much as some fans might hate to see it happen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There's a special Friday episode on Sept. 23.</h2><p>Perhaps to make up for the fact that there's no new episode tonight, there is a special Big Brother episode scheduled for Friday, Sept. 23. Friday night episodes are few and far in between on this show, though there will likely be more than game play.</p><p>The Sept. 22 episode will include the eviction to get the houseguests down to the final three. After that, there's a multi-part final Head of Household competition that should span the final three episodes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I need Taylor's ancestors to be with her on Friday when she completes in the Final HOH she really needs this üò≠üôè <a href=#>#BB24</a></p>‚Äî TAYLOR MADE FINAL 3 DROP A TEAR (@allhaletaylor) <a href=#>September 21, 2022</a></figure><p>The episode that airs before the Big Brother finale is usually a clip show of sorts. We might see how the final three got to where they are, what the jury thinks of the remaining houseguests, and what the strategy may be for the final three players. However, we could also see the first part of the <a href=#>final HOH competition</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the 'Big Brother 24' finale?</h2><p>The Big Brother finale for Season 24 airs on Sunday, Sept. 25 at 8 p.m. EST on CBS. During this two-hour episode, we will see who wins the rest of the HOH competition and which two players are in the final two. Then, the jury votes on who they want to win. There may also be the usual jury roundtable discussion hosted by Big Brother legend <a href=#>Will Kirby</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span><p>Monte from 'Big Brother.'</p></figure><p>But before we can get to the finale, we'll need to see who is sent to jury on Thursday night.
