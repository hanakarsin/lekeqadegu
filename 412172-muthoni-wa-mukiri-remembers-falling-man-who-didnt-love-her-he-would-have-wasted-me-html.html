It was hard for me to understand why he decided to go silent on me. The first thing that automatically comes into your mind is maybe you did something wrong."<p class=align-left>The YouTuber further revealed that some people play such games when they are not ready to settle down.</p>"However, we forget the reason they pull away is because you're too good for them because they can't level up, your level of maturity is on another level and they are still playing with other men and women," she said.<p class=align-left>Muthoni went ahead to advise women to know their value and never settle or less.</p>"For me, at that time I forgot that I am so amazing that anybody wants to date me. I forgot how good I am. But now when I look back and see how my life turned out, that guy would have wasted me big time. I feel sometimes the reason they walk way is because you're too good for them. And at times when we push it, we lower our standards for such people," she said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4cd83e70fc424a29.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Former TGT Music Group Member Tank Discloses He's Gradually Going Deaf in Heartbreaking Instagram Video</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She added:</p>"If someone does not choose me or feel he does not want to be with me, that is the biggest turnoff."<p class=align-left>The businesswoman is currently dating a man named Isaac, and little is known about him, and she said:</p>"Growing up my dream relationship was to be with someone who was consistent, a guy who was really interested in me."<p class=align-left>While speaking to Teacher Wanjiku, a guest on her channel, Muthoni revealed that women are the worst bullies on social media.</p>"They (women) usually tell me first to go and give birth.
