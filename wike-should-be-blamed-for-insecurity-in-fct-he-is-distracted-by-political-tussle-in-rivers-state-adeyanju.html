Wike’s attention is divided. He is not interested in running the FCT because he is struggling to maintain a political structure in Rivers State. He is shouting all over the place and instead of being all over the place in FCT to secure lives and properties, he is jumping all over the place.</p><p>“It is ironic that just two days ago, Wike was blaming the area council chairmen for the insecurity in the FCT by claiming that they did not stay in their councils. Wike is barely here (in the FCT) and when he is, he is meeting Rivers people in the ministry or at his house. The meetings are, in essence, about Rivers’ politics. So, he is not interested in the administration of the FCT.”</p><p>He also accused the security agencies of failing in their duties, alleging that the Police Force is more focused on VIP protection while the Department of State Services (DSS) is also busy eavesdropping on conversations of political enemies and opposition members instead of intelligence gathering.</p><p>“There is a complete failure of intelligence gathering in the country, not just about the IGP’s office alone. Yes, the police which were originally created for the maintenance of internal security, and intelligence gathering have failed in their responsibility. The police are more of a VIP protection institution now and the Department of State Services should be doing better and helping the police since the police have failed in their responsibilities and are busy eavesdropping on conversations of political enemies, opposition members, activists and critics of the government,” Adeyanju added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FqZrChm5p6tLTOrqOdZZKaeqO4wKacnWWWpL9utc2snJytop7BunnIp2Sfm6RitaZ5yKxknaGjqb%2Bir9Oem2aaqWK9sLjIraCcmZxiwba%2F0qWcZqGeYr%2BqwsSrqmarpJbBpnnAnZyymZ6fwnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-nba-youngboy-get-arrested.html><span>←</span><span>Did NBA Youngboy Get Arrested?
