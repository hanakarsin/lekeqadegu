The former child star's lawyer David Esquibias confirmed the news to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 34-year-old has been reportedly struggling with mental health and substance-abuse issues for more than a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Esquibias (via Us), the 34-year-old is not currently living in a "sober living facility" but is "sheltering at a safe environment" during the current coronavirus pandemic (also known as COVID-19). So, <a href=#>did Amanda relapse</a>?</p><p>The All That alum has been somewhat open with fans about her issues with addiction and her mental health issues over the years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is wrong with Amanda Bynes? The former actor has a history of substance abuse issues.</h2><p>Since 2014, Amanda has been under a conservatorship (Amanda's parents control her major life decisions) after suffering a mental breakdown amid her ongoing issues with drug addiction. In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper Magazine</a>, the FIT graduate opened up about her personal issues and why she decided to quit acting.&nbsp;</p><p>"I just had no purpose in life. I’d been working my whole life and [now] I was doing nothing,” she said.</p><p>She continued: “I had a lot of time on my hands and I would ‘wake and bake’ and literally be stoned all day long. … [I was] hanging out with a seedier crowd and I isolated a lot … I got really into my drug usage and it became a really dark, sad world for me.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Following her interview with Paper, where she revealed that she was four years sober, Amanda suffered another setback and went to rehab in March 2019. After completing treatment, she entered a sober living facility but left in mid-December after reportedly failing to comply with the house rules.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Amanda Bynes diagnosed with bipolar disorder?</h2><p>Shortly after retiring from Hollywood, Amanda was involved in a bit of legal trouble, such as being arrested for a DUI and a hit and run. After a slew of questionable tweets, the former actor posted in a <a href=#>now-deleted tweet</a> that she had been "diagnosed [as bipolar] and manic depressive." Adding, "I'm on medication and I'm seeing my psychologist and psychiatrist weekly so I'm fine :D.” &nbsp;</p><p>However, the following day she tweeted: "I was at a [friend's] apartment last night and one of my friends tweeted my phone." Since then, Amanda has not confirmed if she is suffering from a particular mental health diagnosis, but has cited drugs as the reason for her erratic behavior.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"Truly, for me, [my behavior] was drug-induced, and whenever I got off of [drugs], I was always back to normal," she told Paper Magazine. "I know that my behavior was so strange that people were just trying to grasp at straws for what was wrong."&nbsp;</p><p>Well, we hope the She's the Man actor is getting the necessary help she needs. Seriously, we'll always be #TeamAmanda!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmavoqS7qHnWoquhZZGirq%2BwwGaZsqaVqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aisha-falode-insists-womens-world-cup-prize-money-will-be-paid-to-nff-enakhena-makes-threats.html><span>←</span><span>Aisha Falode Insists Women's World Cup Prize Money Will Be Paid To NFF, Enakhena Makes Threats</span></a>
