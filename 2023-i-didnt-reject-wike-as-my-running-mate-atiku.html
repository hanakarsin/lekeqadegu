The committee that was set up at my own instance, deliberated. There was no vote and they recommended three names. Because they knew that it was prerogative to pick nay one of the three. So there was absolutely no vote, it s not true.</p><p>“Ortom himself chaired the committee. He knows that there was no vote taken and I have the report of the committee. They recommended three people and out of the three people, I picked one. I did not go out of the recommendation. So, I think people should be fair to me and should also state the facts.</p><p>“Governor Wike is a brilliant politician, he is courageous, he is tenacious and I believe he has a future in the political evolution of the country. So it is not a question of rejection. Certainly not. I think it is too harsh a word to say that we rejected Governor Wike. Certainly not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZmtoYmh6qnnDopunrF2nsquxwq1ksKGbmnqiv4ymsGaqpaO7qrrGZqSarJVirrW1yq5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./labour-party-is-under-a-siege-party-reacts-to-call-by-state-chairmen-for-abure-to-step-down.html><span>←</span><span>'Labour Party Is Under A Siege'</span></a>
