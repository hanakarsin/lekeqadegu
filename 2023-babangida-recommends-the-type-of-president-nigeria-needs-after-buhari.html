That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.</p><p>“That is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.”</p><p>Speaking on the unity of Nigeria and the challenges facing the country, IBB noted that apart from bad leadership, the citizens themselves have lost hope in the country but he believes Nigeria has a great future.</p><p>He however stressed the need for patriotism and patience to overcome the challenges facing the country.</p><p>“I do believe in the future of Nigeria, but Nigerians don’t believe in the future of their country.
