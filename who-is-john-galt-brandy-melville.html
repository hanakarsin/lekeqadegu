Indeed, Stephan Marsan is so into the economic philosophy, he used copies of Atlas Shrugged in his stores as props.</p><p>He also named a sub-brand of Brandy Melville by the name of the character in the Ayn Rand tome.</p><p>So for confused patrons of the popular teen brand, it starts to make sense why when you visit the Brandy Melville <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> or visit a store, you can also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shop John Galt styles</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@oliviasdiqry href=#>@oliviasdiqry</a><p>please tell me someone understands this üò≠ | <a title=brandymellville href=#>#brandymellville</a> <a title=brandy href=#>#brandy</a> <a title=onesize href=#>#onesize</a> <a title=johngalt href=#>#johngalt</a> <a title=clothing href=#>#clothing</a> <a title=shirts href=#>#shirts</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=thatgirl href=#>#thatgirl</a> <a title=tips href=#>#tips</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=forupage href=#>#forupage</a> <a title=xyzcba href=#>#xyzcba</a> <a title=aesthetic href=#>#aesthetic</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ SCARY TOPS - Mia Salinas" href=#>‚ô¨ SCARY TOPS - Mia Salinas</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, are John Galt and Brandy Melville the same thing?</h2><p>Again, John Galt, also known as J. Galt, is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-brand</a> of Brandy Melville, so they aren't exactly the same thing, but it's not too different in the end.</p><p>If you're starting to get a picture of the entire situation, it's worth mentioning that for some, the association of the character with extreme views and the brand is a turn-off.</p><p>But, this isn't the first controversy that the brand has faced.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Brandy Melville backlash is a big part of the brand.</h2><p>There have been so many <a href=#>controversies associated with the brand</a>, it's actually the subject of a documentary on <a href=#>Max</a> called Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion.</p><p>Notably, the employees have opened up about experiencing racism and misogyny in stores.</p><p>The founder is also keen on selling styles mostly for thin girls and women, with its "one size fits all" approach. This obviously leaves out an entire demographic of shoppers who have felt ignored or even shamed by the brand.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brandy Melville is one of the most legend brands out there.
