More specifically, the police procedural series takes place in East New York, Brooklyn’s most eastern residential neighborhood. Situated on the water, East New York is a small community with eclectic businesses, parks, restaurants, and more.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"What’s so great about filming here is that we're in East New York and then around it, you really get the sense of what the community's like," Warren told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in September.</p><p>"There’s really beautiful people here, really beautiful parks and recreation, and activities to do.
