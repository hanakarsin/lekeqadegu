I hope they are the ones, we will keep on praying until they are released.”</p><p>However another unnamed parent said he watched the video but couldn't identify any of his missing daughters, he raised questions concerning the validity of the video.</p><p>Another parent, who talked to Telegraph of London, said that he will rather have his daughter perish than change religion, He said: “I have not yet seen the video, but I am not really interested in what Boko Haram’s demands are. My daughter is a Christian, she will never change. I would rather she died as a Christian than convert to Islam.”</p><p>“I don’t want a prisoner exchange either; our daughters are not prisoners, and they should not be exchanged for anyone. Let the government try to rescue them. If they have a prisoner exchange that will look like the government is giving in to Boko Haram, and it will just encourage them to take more hostages,” he said.</p><p>Another parent Lawan Zannah while speaking to Vanguard journalists on phone, said he could not watch the video but is relieved that his angel might be alive. He said: “I have not watched it, but I hope they are the ones. It gladdened my heart when I heard that they showed the video on BBC, that means they are still alive. I call on the Federal Government to do everything possible to secure their release.”</p><p>“We also call on you and other Nigerians to join us in praying for the safe release of our daughters”, Zannah stated.</p><p>However a Maiduguri resident Alhaji Hassan Ibrahim has doubts over the video saying some girls in the video look overage.&nbsp;</p><p>Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, ordered on May 12, 2014, for mass production of the film so as to enable parents identify their wards and ease concerns of if the kids were still alive.</p><p>The video showed over 100 girls dressed in &nbsp;black and grey full-length hijabs and reciting the first chapter of the Qur'an, then three of the girls where interviewed. Two revealed they used to be Christians, but have now converted.</p><p>Shekau did not appear in the same shot with the girls. He spoke in Hausa and Arabic and further revealed that the girls have now converted. He also made his demand for exchange of Boko Haram prisoners for the girls who have not converted.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3d9l29loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-isnt-big-brother-on-tonight.html><span>←</span><span>'Big Brother 24's Final Episodes Are (Almost) Here</span></a>
