Who are they giving orders, who are they commanding? I believe there has to be a common understanding, we should come together and mutually agree on the issue about the country.</p><p>“We are convinced that Nigeria deserves leaders that can unite it. We are aware and very concerned about the current situation of the Nigerian state as it is today, where our unity has been bastardized, and the country is almost, one could say, on the brink. Therefore, all patriotic leaders across party lines are concerned.</p><p>“Perhaps only people who are happy with Nigeria today are those who are benefitting from the confusion that is happening at the centre, but the vast majority of our leaders and statesmen are very worried that Nigeria is drifting and drifting very fast.</p><p>“Therefore, there is the need for us to come together, first, as a party to unite ourselves and present a candidate for the office of the president. Someone that is competent and will be, by the grace of God, a president of Nigeria and for Nigerians and not a sectional president — not a president from a particular zone.</p><p>“Nigeria needs a president that will provide leadership that people will be comfortable with, a president that understands the dynamics of the Nigeria state as at today and all that is at play.”</p><p>Those in the entourage include former Minister of Power, Alhaji Suleiman Bello as well as the 2019 governorship candidate of the party in Kebbi state, Gen. Bello Sarkin Yaki.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49rZmtoYmh6ra3MopuoZZWjsbC%2B0p6qZqyRoq%2B2w8ClZJqrm6h6sLjDZqeopJmptqS1wKeqZqyfYrSqwsRmrpqxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-i-didnt-reject-wike-as-my-running-mate-atiku.html><span>←</span><span>2023: I Didn't Reject Wike As My Running Mate</span></a>
