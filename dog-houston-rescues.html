Irma has already slammed the Caribbean, reducing some areas to rubble.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Hurricane Harvey moved into Texas as a Category 4 hurricane over the weekend, and has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. Despite being downgraded, Harvey is still the strongest storm to hit the United States since Charley in August 2004 and the most powerful to hit Texas since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hurricane Carla in 1961</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>National Weather Service</strong></a> predicted that as much as 50 inches of rain has fallen in some areas, and at least five deaths have been reported. Perhaps the hardest hit area has been Houston, the most populous city in the state, with millions being affected by flash flooding. &nbsp;</p><p>Joel Osteen, head of the Lakewood mega-church in Houston, Texas, also became the focus of the Internet's anger over the past several days. When Hurricane Harvey hit the coast, flooding huge swaths of land and leaving thousands without shelter, Osteen refused to open the doors of his 17,000-seat building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Osteen then began claiming the church was inaccessible due to flooding, despite pictures people quickly shared on Twitter showing the premises almost completely unharmed. In response to the intense public outcry, Osteen finally bowed to pressure and opened Lakewood to those in need.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpZ2R9eXuSaWZqgYOohIN7w6ieZqCfqsC1u81mqZ6rk6qytA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-home-and-family-show.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Happened to Hallmark's 'Home &amp;amp; Family' Show?
