In February, the Trump administration signed a pact with the Taliban setting a timetable for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the spring of 2021.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did the KKK endorse Trump?</h2><p>The KKK, a white supremacist hate group, has not formally endorsed Trump’s reelection bid, according to Newsweek, but former KKK grand wizard David Duke endorsed Trump in 2016 and tweeted his support of Trump’s reelection this July, advocating for Tucker Carlson to replace Mike Pence as vice president. “Trump & Tucker is the only way to stop the commie Bolsheviks!
