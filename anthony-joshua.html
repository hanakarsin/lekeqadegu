The Nigerian-British-born took to his Twitter handle and responded to Fury’s antics saying: “Yea calm.

During an appearance on talkSPORT on Tuesday, the former champion said: “I had a chat last night with George Warren from Queensberry (Promotions).</p><p>“I’d love to get really excited about this because I think it’s the fight I get stopped on the street for more than any fight that could be made.</p><p>“It’s a fight AJ has wanted for a long time.</p><p>“Don’t forget we signed for this fight last year before the court arbitration forced Deontay Wilder to fight for Tyson Fury.</p><p>“It’s an interesting one because last week he retired, then he’d only come back to fight Usyk, then he made an offer to Derek Chisora, then he wanted half a billion, then he retired again, then he’s fighting Usyk in December and now he’s fighting Joshua.</p><p>“The message is quite clear from Joshua; we don’t want to get in a backwards and forwards, we want the fight.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that Fury and Joshua were supposed to meet in the ring last year after agreeing on a stunning two-fight deal in March 2020.</p><p>But former WBC heavyweight champ Deontay Wilder scuppered the undisputed bout when he won his arbitration for a trilogy fight with Fury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49wZpqmpJ28r8WMo6asoKWWfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-atiku-trying-to-play-funny-wikes-camp-insists-ayu-must-go-for-pdp-to-have-peace.html><span>←</span><span>'Atiku Trying To Play Funny'</span></a>
