"I think, if we end up shut down for the season, they will fold into season 22. We'll figure it out. For now just glad crew out of harm's way, worried so many are out of work, and sad fans get a truncated season."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 22 has just begun to film.</h2><p>On Sept. 12, Captain Olivia Benson's Mariska Hargitay shared some exciting news with her friends.
