While many of us are staying home in an effort to thwart the spread of COVID-19, binge-watching everything Netflix (and Hulu, and Disney Plus) has to offer is one of the only things to do. Now, your binge-watching sesh can get meta with a new documentary that’s all about the coronavirus. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Coronavirus, Explained</u><u> is on Netflix</u></a> — here’s what we know about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The first episode of ‘Coronavirus, Explained’ is currently streaming on Netflix.</h2><p>Coronavirus, Explained is a mini spinoff season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Explained</u></a>, the weekly documentary series on Netflix that’s produced by Vox Media in the style of their very popular YouTube videos. Former episodes of Explained have covered everything from K-Pop to athleisure to cults. Back in November of 2019, there was an episode called “The Next Pandemic,” which was all about the history of pandemics, how they spread, and what could be done to contain the next one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Of course, at the time, the show’s creators didn’t realize that “the next pandemic” was literally right around the corner. Now that we’re currently living through the no-longer-hypothetical next pandemic, Vox has made another super relevant limited series all about it. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Hollywood Reporter</u></a>, Vox was in the process of brainstorming topics for Explained Season 3 in mid-March of 2020 when Netflix reached out to request the Coronavirus, Explained series.</p><p>While the team initially planned to have 10 weeks to work on each episode of their next Explained season, the sudden prevalence of COVID-19 pushed up their production schedule and they made the first episode of the limited series in two-and-a-half weeks.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How was ‘Coronavirus, Explained’ made during the pandemic?</h2><p>Obviously, now is not the easiest time to be making any type of shows. People can’t gather together to film anything, and anything that is filmed has to be edited remotely. So how did Vox Media make Coronavirus, Explained during the actual coronavirus pandemic?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Well, remember how we mentioned the episode of Explained all about “The Next Pandemic”? In order to make that episode, Vox interviewed Bill Gates — whose philanthropic work is heavily focused on global health, and who is also currently a <a href=#><u>major funder of COVID-19 vaccine research</u></a>. Vox ended up using some of that interview footage in the first episode of Coronavirus, Explained.</p><p>If you watch the first episode, you’ll see that other interviews were conducted remotely. The Explained videos often include a lot of charts and other graphics so Coronavirus, Explained remains true to form in that regard. In order to get the episode out so quickly, Vox leaned heavily on archival footage and animators. They also shipped J.K. Simmons (who had narrated the “Next Pandemic” episode) a recording kit so he could narrate the new episode from home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix has a new series “Corona virus explained” for anyone still saying “wtf just happened?
