Speaking to journalists in Maiduguri on March 8, Saidu argued that the absence of ransom demands was evidence against the abduction theory.</p><p>He was quoted by Punch to have said, “If they were abducted, the abductors would have, by now, called for ransom; but nobody has called anybody for any ransom yet.</p><p>“You would have observed that the state government restrained all along from quoting any number because we know the IDPs very well because we are the ones managing their affairs; they are economical with the truth.”</p><p>Dr. Saidu explained: “We don’t believe the IDPs in this abduction narrative and the number of those they said were abducted; the IDPs are not trustworthy.</p><p>“There is no trust between them (IDPs) and government and between them and NGOs; there is even no trust among themselves; if it is about food and other essential commodities distribution, or they want to raise public sympathy for them among the public, they exaggerate numbers; if it is about anything they don’t want, like immunisation, they reduce numbers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BpZqehnpp6sMHTZqafZWFlf26twZ2snKyVmXqju9GnpmahlKXAbr7Erayrpl2dvK6xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-former-nigerian-governor-dies-of-covid-19.html><span>←</span><span>Former Nigerian Governor Dies Of COVID-19</span></a>
