There are so many factors which may contribute to weight gain, and excessive eating is just one of them. Some people become fat, and it stops at a certain weight, others bear the burden of seeing their weight get out of control to double or even triple.</p><h2>Fattest people in the world</h2><p class=align-left>While it might be a bother to gain a kilo or two in a while to some of us, the struggle others go through is in an entirely different league. For this faction of people, they are looking at about hundreds of kilos. To them, their battle is no longer about shape. It is about life. These are some of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the world’s fattest people</a> with us today.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67711b6a19526fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Power Celebrates Auto Electrician Mechanic Zipporah Mulati, Who Gave Birth to All Her Kids via C-Section</span></p></a><h3>1. Paul Merson</h3><p class=align-left>Paul Merson was once considered the fattest person in the world. At that time, Merson was weighing about 980 pounds (444.5 Kg). His weight problem began when he suffered a heart attack at the time of his father’s death and deterioration of his mother’s health. He, however, managed to undergo gastric surgery and the weight went down to around 560 pounds.</p><h3>2. Patrick Deuel</h3><p class=align-left>Think of someone being referred to as a 1000 pound man! Patrick Deuel could be the one. He weighed 1072 pounds and was commonly known as ‘Half-ton man’ among his peers, <a href=#>family</a> members, and the general public. Patrick Deuel had to undergo gastric surgery to save his life. After the operation, he lost a considerable amount of weight, but he is still obese with a lot of health-related issues.</p><h3>3. Donna Simpson</h3><p class=align-left>Donna Simpson, at some point, wanted to be the heaviest woman in the world. Her target weight was 1000 pounds (450 Kg).

Her efforts were rewarded in 2007 when she was honored by the Guinness World Record holder for the ‘<i>heaviest woman to give birth</i>.’ She had given birth to her daughter through caesarian.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/19348f7179157f43.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>'My 600-lb Life' deaths: List of all members who passed away</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top 10 best Quran reciters in the world in 2019</p><p class=align-left>Simpson later abandoned her quest and resolved to go on a diet to manage her weight in 2011.
