To me, President Goodluck Jonathan is a project of hope, a mission for justice, equity and fair play. I will forever stand with the oppressed, the marginalized.&nbsp; President Goodluck Jonathan, without a doubt is a good man that mean well for all Nigerians, but dark forces are bent on crippling his Presidency.”</p><p>“Politics goes beyond dog eat dog. It is a game of master chess players. Swimming against a 20 feet ocean wave is an act in futility. &nbsp;Ask Mallam Balarabe Musa, former Governor of old Kaduna State; a great Nigerian that meant well for his people, but he got consumed by forces beyond him. Above all, he got impeached based on the principles of democracy: majority will always have their way. All the good things he wanted to do for the good people of Kaduna State, gone. President Goodluck Jonathan’s detractors paint him as weak; on the contrary, he is a very strong and smart man.” he further said.</p><p>On why he has not been featuring in movies of recent he said, "well, as you journey through life, you get to a point where you ask yourself some tough but radical questions. I sat down, and had my usual rare deep one on one with God and decided to take a break from the entertainment industry.

So, I might have been quiet, but I have been very loud with ground breaking visionary strides.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnaFmG9loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happens-when-you-drop-a-player-in-fantasy-football.html><span>←</span><span>What Happens When You Drop a Player in Fantasy Football?</span></a>
