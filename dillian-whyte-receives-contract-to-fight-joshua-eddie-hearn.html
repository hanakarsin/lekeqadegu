Not really (expecting it to be signed) in all honesty. If they want the fight, it’s there. It’s not going to be difficult. They’ve said they agree to the offer, which initially was completely unacceptable apparently.</p><p>“We’ve got to move. So, they’re going to have their time. I’m going to give them the time to review it and if they want to do it they can do it.”</p><p>If Dillian Whyte signs the contract, he will take on Joshua on August 12 at London’s O2 Arena. If he fails to sign the contract, the attention could shift to an attentive contender who could be German boxer Agit Kabayel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FvZp2hnKG2orqMsJ%2ByrJViv6avxKKtnqtdmLyvwNGamq1lpKR6p7XGoatmop%2BotbatjJ6bnaGVYrWmrdGnZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1173394-daniel-ademinokan-shares-photos-wife-doris-simeon-son-html.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Ademinokan shares photos with ex-wife Doris Simeon and son</span></a>
