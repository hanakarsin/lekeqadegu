Furthermore, it signifies the end of Pogba’s career with his current club, Juventus, as his contract expires in the summer of 2026. Unfortunately, his second stint with the club has been a disaster.</p><p>In 2022, the Frenchman, who had previously triumphed with his nation in the 2018 World Cup, made a comeback to Turin from Manchester United on a free transfer.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pogba’s first season was plagued by frequent injuries, and this season, he only managed to make two appearances before facing suspension.</p><p>Regrettably, it seems that his international career is now nearing its end.</p><p>Pogba had amassed an impressive 91 caps for his nation, with his last appearance occurring in 2022, and he had also contributed 11 goals. Notably, he played a pivotal role in securing France’s second World Cup victory during the 2018 tournament held in Russia.</p><p>Speaking in December, France boss Didier Deschamps said: “I love all my players, but I’m sad about what Paul is living. I’m not just talking about the most recent events, but also about everything he has experienced so far, with the personal problems that have inevitably had consequences on his injuries. I feel bad for Pogba: how can he do it?”</p><p>Elsewhere, speaking before the second sample was tested, Pogba’s representative Rafaela Pimenta said: “We are waiting for the counter-analysis and until then we can’t say anything. The certain thing is that Paul Pogba never wanted to break the rules.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FyZpuqlZa4qrrGZqearZxivbCzwZpkoZmembKlecWorKtlqZqus3nBmqVmnqKkum6yzqirm5mcoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1419675-joaquin-guzman-children-el-chapos-kids-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joaqun Guzmn's children: what is known about El Chapos kids?</span></a>
