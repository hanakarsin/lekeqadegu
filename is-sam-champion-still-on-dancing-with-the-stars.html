So, I had a lot of nerve pain yesterday and the day before. Had a lot of pain in my left leg. And that was kind of a brutal night to get through last night. That’s the first time that physically I felt beat up. There’s a lot of stretching, a lot of all of that happens. But boy, that was a tough night."</p><p>He did also note that his legs are feeling better thanks to the medical connections his dancing partner, <a href=#>Cheryl Burke</a>, was able to introduce him to.
