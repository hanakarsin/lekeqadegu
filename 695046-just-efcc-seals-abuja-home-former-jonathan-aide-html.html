Tony Badeh who is a pilot, and family were already out of the country as at the time the anti-graft agency stormed the house, a source who prefers to be anonymous disclosed to Legit.ng in Abuja.</p><p>The source also told our correspondent that the son of the former CDS, Tony Badeh had fore-knowledge of EFCC's visit and had to quickly travel to South Africa with his family yesterday.</p><p>Speaking on what transpired, Badeh's gateman, Mr Timothy in a discussion with other domestic staff said there was little he could do. A visibly sad Timothy also said he had to call his boss, Mr Tony Badeh and who then instructed him not to resist the EFCC officials or deny them entry into the house.</p><p><i>" When they came here I did not resist them. I only called my Oga who told me to allow them,"</i> a sad Timothy disclosed.</p><p>One of the neighbours who craved for anonymity&nbsp; also disclosed to Legit.ng that security officials have been monitoring the house for about 2 weeks.</p><p><i>"They have been coming here for a while. I mean the SSS and police people. The&nbsp; last time they (EFCC) came we learnt that they (the Badehs) didn't receive the letter from them"</i></p><p>This statement was however corroborated by a resident in the area who simply gave his name as Mohammed. Mr Mohammed told our correspondent that the EFCC and some security operatives had earlier stormed the house to seize close to 15 new exotic cars parked in the compound before sealing it off.</p><p>"<i>The EFCC before sealing the house drove out close to 15 fine fine cars to unknown locations. It was when I knew that something is not going on well."</i></p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p>Meanwhile, efforts to reach the EFCC spokesperson as at the time of filling this report proved abortive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt3s37kk94hsh.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4t1defurfk4.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4qiuvlnijds.jpeg><p>Meanwhile, Adeyanju Deji, the Peoples Democratic Party’s director of new media, has narrated what transpired when he visited Olisa Metuh, the PDP’s spokesperson, who was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) last week.</p><p>In a series of tweets Deji stated that even though Metuh looked grey and tired, he said that he was strong and nobody would break him.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3qBj21tZqKlqMFuscWcmmarlZa5tHnAm6yjmV2dvK6xjJ%2Bmq6WVp3qru82aq6GZnmKuqrDEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./373493-beatrice-elachi-ex-speakers-fate-sealed-state-house-uhuru-asked-step-down-html.html><span>←</span><span>Beatrice Elachi: Ex-Speaker's fate was sealed at State House after Uhuru asked her to step down</span></a>
