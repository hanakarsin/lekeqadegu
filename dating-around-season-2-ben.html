"Seems like he comes from such a pure place."</p><p>California native Ben moved to New Orleans two years ago for a change of pace. The hopeless romantic, who is described by his friends and family as a textbook nice guy, has only been in one relationship before—but it lasted over a decade.</p><p>The relationship ended when his partner wanted to open up their relationship, and Ben accepted the decision reluctantly. He recalls surprising himself when he didn't feel jealous at his partner being with another man. Instead, the open arrangement taught him that the decade-old relationship wasn't the right one for him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ben from Dating Around S2 needs to be protected at all costs.

The charmer presents each of his five dates with flowers, and seems equally invested in learning about the women and complimenting them.</p><p>On one of the blind arrangements, Ben ends up on a date with a student at the University of New Orleans, which happens to be where he teaches. He goes through the date gracefully, and then gives her a heads up that he'd like to talk to the university's HR should their relationship develop, to make sure everything is above board. We stan an honest, thoughtful, and consent-oriented gentleman!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's Ben up to these days?</h2><p>There's no arguing that Ben's episode was a mix of awkward and adorable, and while we don't know if he ended up making a lasting connection with any of his dates, we are loving his new social media presence and hope to stay on his updates now that he has an Instagram account.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Despite the world's best efforts to teach me, I have no idea how Instagram works.

After watching other people's posts for so long, I'm finally throwing my hat in the Instagram ring too! My understanding is that this is called *quality content* baby! Expect plenty more where this came from! Also, uh, in addition to the momentousness of my first post, for historical record purposes, we're three months into a global pandemic and courageous people are protesting throughout all 50 states for social justice. I couldn't be more proud of everyone doing what they need to survive, and for those who are fighting to make the world a better place.
