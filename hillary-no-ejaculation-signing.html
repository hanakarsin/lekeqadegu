That was our starting point. We thought, Hey, why don’t we make such a picture?"<p><strong>In case you were wondering, the original photo was taken when Barack Obama awarded the Congressional Medal to WASPs, a group of female WW2 fighter Pilots.</strong></p><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"><span>Source: pete souza | the white house</span></figure><p><strong>52 was last seen protesting the yearly winter fashion sales in France, and they made a pretty awesome video about it.</strong></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Liquidons les inégalités!</a><p>Nous représentons 52% de la population française, nous sommes la majorité, nous décidons, nous agissons ! #NOUSSOMMESPUISSANTES</p>Posted by <a href=#>52</a> on Tuesday, January 10, 2017</figure><p>Even their protest videos are art-house.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>30-Year-Old Evicted from His Parents’ House Gives the Cringiest Interview Ever</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>These Shameless Girls Bragged About Stealing a Tip Jar — But the Internet Tracked Them Down</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Girl Found out Her Boyfriend Was Cheating from a Jimmy Johns Delivery Guy</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9qbmhoYWR%2FeXu5aqarbIaNfKm1y6WYq7Fdo7xuscmamq6kkam2sLqMrKCgppmjtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1396387-nigerian-man-bought-1st-house-3-years-canada-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Man Says He Bought His 1st House 3 Years after Relocating to Canada; Shares Photos</span></a>
