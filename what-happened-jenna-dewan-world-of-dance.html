Here’s what you need to know about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World of Dance</a> Season 3 before the contestants hit the stage.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Jenna Dewan on World of Dance?</h2><p>The 38-year-old announced her departure from the series in October with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>. "Hi to my World of Dance lovers! I have some news to share: I will not be returning to the show as host for season 3. But! I won’t be able to stay away for long, and plan to return to mentor contestants as much as possible," Jenna wrote at the time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"It has been an absolute thrill to be a part of this incredible, groundbreaking show from the very beginning, and I am forever grateful to my @nbc family, @jlo, @derekhough @neyo and everyone involved in this journey. We are changing the dance world and giving opportunities to dancers in ways I've only dreamed of! Can't wait to share more news with you soon. Much love to everyone."</p><p>From the looks of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb page</a>, it appears Jenna has plenty on her plate. The Step Up alum co-stars in this month’s Berlin, I Love You, an ensemble drama that also features Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Hayden Panettiere.</p><p>She’ll also appear alongside Sarah Hyland and Anna Camp in the upcoming romantic comedy The Wedding Year and has a leading role in the Netflix musical drama, Mixtape.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Not to mention, the former backup dancer is mom to 5-year-old daughter Everly, whom she shares with ex Channing Tatum. But don’t expect to see the kindergartener up on the World of Dance stage any time soon. "She hasn't been bitten by the dance bug," Jenna previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra TV</a>. "She's more Coachella than she is, like, ballet school."</p><p>Though Jenna's stepping away from her hosting gig, she's leaving us in very capable (and handsome) hands.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is new host Scott Evans?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fans may recognize Scott from Access, the daily entertainment news program anchored by Natalie Morales. The 32-year-old has been a correspondent for the show since 2015, so he’s definitely used to being in front of the camera. In fact, the New Jersey native even worked the red carpet at this year’s Academy Awards.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">December Instagram post</a> announcing his new job, Scott wrote, "To be able to host a show I so love and admire, to work with another incredible team that leads with its heart, to feel a part of something much bigger and brighter than I could imagine... has been a dream. #THANKYOU @nbc @jlo @neyo @derekhough. I cannot wait till everyone gets to see the unbelievable talent this season!"</p><p>We wouldn’t mind seeing the TV personality bust a move or two when he's up there! Catch new World of Dance episodes every Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnJnqWnmV2ZsritzWauqKqcmXqwsoydmKeblQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./291554-je-mtu-anaweza-kuugua-kansa-ya-moyo-soma-jibu-hapa-html.html><span>←</span><span>Je, mtu anaweza kuugua kansa ya moyo?
