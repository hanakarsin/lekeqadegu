Reggie Mantle dies in Season 6.</h2><p>Charles joined the Riverdale cast as Reggie after <a href=#>13 Reasons Why</a> actor Ross Butler made his exit from the series. Since then, he’s been entangled in a three-way love triangle between Archie and Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), which is a thing of the past in Season 6.</p><p>With Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) carrying Archie’s baby <a href=#>for a time</a> and Veggie becoming the most powerful couple in town, things are looking up for the gang — that is until Archie is brutally murdered by Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) in a sacrificial ritual and Reggie makes a deal with the devil (literally).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>In “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter Nighty-Eight: Mr. Cypher</a>,” Reggie tells Veronica that he accepted a monetary investment from Satan in exchange for his soul.</p><p>He explains, “When we were looking for investors, I got an incoming call from him, he said he could provide us with the rest of the money we needed in exchange for … a soul. My soul,” he adds. “And he’s here to collect it this Saturday night, at midnight. You gotta help me. If anyone can outwit the Devil, Ronnie, it’s you.”</p><p>Despite Veronica’s efforts, Reggie is sentenced to eternal damnation and sent to the pits of hell. But that doesn’t mean that we’ve seen the last of Charles Melton. Charles has yet to reveal the character’s fate on Riverdale, but it will take either a miracle or magic to bring him back. Luckily, there’s a new witch in town who has mastered the latter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kiernan Shipka (@kiernanshipka)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sabrina Spellman actress Kiernan Shipka joins the cast of ‘Riverdale’ in Season 6.</h2><p>Many fans were devastated by the series finale of Netflix’s Chilling Adventure of Sabrina when the leading lady faced a tragic end, but she’s returned from the dead in Season 6 and she could be the key to restoring order in Riverdale.</p><p>Showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa confirmed that Archie really is dead, so it’s not looking good for his now-deceased co-stars — including Reggie. He previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a>, “And I’ll say this: That’s only the start of the body count for Rivervale.”</p><p>However, the executive producer also confirmed that Archie would be back in the 100th episode of Riverdale, which hints that Reggie and the rest of the gang will return from the dead too.</p><p>Reggie’s fate will be revealed in new episodes of Riverdale Tuesdays on the CW at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8eaqaWdo2K6prjTqKVmpJWWw6q6xmapoq6Vp7GiuMQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-nicholas-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jimmy Nicholas - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
