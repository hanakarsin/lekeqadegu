It says working through the member association – working through your federations, we will pay you this money through the federations.</p><p>“FIFA will pay the federations the money, and the federation pays the players with the instruction. Everybody knows it is there in black and white.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Nigerian veteran journalist and football club administrator, Godwin Enakhena who is currently the chairman of Sporting Lagos FC, has vowed to expose anyone who touches the prize money.</p><p>“You’re wrong if you think I’m holding forth for anyone or even the NFF. Mark my words, and on my honor, if a dime is taken from this money meant for the Super Falcons, I’ll let the world know”, he tweeted on Thursday, August 3.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_20230803-163901.jpg alt="Aisha Falode Insists Women's World Cup Prize Money Be Paid To NFF, Enakhena Makes Threats" width=577 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Enakhena’s tweet came after he shared a quote from the president of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, which explains how the prize money will be paid to the 2023 Women’s World Cup participants.</p><p>The quote reads, “We have issued recommendations, but we are an association of associations.
