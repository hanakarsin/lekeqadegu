This M.G.A. tech theory basically postulates that a lot of military and air-space technology ‚Äî along with their capabilities ‚Äî are intentionally kept hidden from society in Area 51, and this technology has been influenced by "found" or "acquired" alien tech that somehow made it to planet earth.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Posted @withrepost ‚Ä¢ @fractalindigo Project Looking Glass Many secretive experiments that test the fabric of Space and Time are conducted behind closed doors in extremely remote facilities by those with a means to do so. Since the early 60s, programs involving reality manipulation have been adopted by the US Navy for secret research and development. One of these startups was known as Project Montauk in which human subjects were trained to interface with extraterrestrial technology. They would interact with a chair that vastly enhanced One‚Äôs psychic ability allowing for a concentrated portal to open in the room that helped access different historical periods. These time-distorting machines seem to be in the hands of both sides fighting a temporal war of timelines. Deep in the heart of Groom Lake lies a covert testing facility known as S4. Fixed to the door frame entrance of a lab sits a three foot tall stuffed white rabbit holding an inverted watch. Project Looking Glass was a program dealing with visualizing the effects of producing artificial gravity to predict the potential probability of future events. This device utilized 6 electromagnetic fields and a height adjustable rotational cylinder that would fill with Argon gas. Scientists used this machinery to warp the local fabric of Spacetime both forward and backwards. When active, images would appear from the projected open zone within the fields, similar to a hologram. Transport pads were located nearby that would teleport physical matter from one location to the next instantaneously. Time Machine manipulation is the root cause for phenomena such as the Mandela Effect and other timeline glitches. President Eisenhower met with various Extraterrestrial intelligence groups about the threat of a nuclear catastrophe. During these talks, an exchange of technology was made where he was gifted a device called the Orion Cube. About 8cm wide and 8cm long, this equipment shared similar properties to Project Looking Glass by lensing future events for observation in the Present. „Éª„Éª„Éª #projectlookingglass #montaukproject #timetravel #indigochildren #starseeds #StrangerThings #spiritualawakening #thegreatawakening #woke</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ascension Vibes üíéüëê</a> (@ascensionvibes1) on Nov 17, 2019 at 1:45pm PST</p></figure><p>This includes a variety of different devices and tech, like the Looking Glass, which, along with the Yellow Cube, is supposedly used for manipulating timelines.</p><p>Yes, this is sounding like the plot behind <a href=#>Avengers: Endgame</a>, but it's a fascinating premise: the glass is actually a portal for us to not only view alternate timelines but also to use it as a sort of time travel device that'll allow those who possess it to influence our current timeline.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what is the Yellow Cube?</h2><p>Also known as the "Yellow Disk", this device, along with Looking Glass, is utilized by not only the industrial-military complex (allegedly) but also Grey Aliens, who both are trying to utilize "networks" of the Yellow Cube to influence timelines.</p><p>Apparently, this cube or disk is a communication device from surviving extra-terrestrial life forms from the earth's future.

However, it's hindered by the "consciousness level" of whoever was present watching future events unfold.
