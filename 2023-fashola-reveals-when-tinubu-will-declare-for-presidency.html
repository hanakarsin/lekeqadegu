There are people speaking for people. Nobody has come out, we are not at that stage yet.</p><p>“I can’t venture out and say that I will speak for X or Y. Let the person come out and say, ‘I want to serve Nigeria’.</p><p>“It pains me sometimes when we see that very important job and responsibility to, ‘My people said’. I think the whole sense of it should be that, ‘I am able, I have looked at myself, give me your problem, you go to sleep’.”</p><p>Fashola when asked if he would support Tinubu in 2023 said, “I saw him (Tinubu) last week, he didn’t tell me he is running for office and to the best of my knowledge, the last statement he made on it is that people will know in January.”</p><p>The Minister added, “No, I didn’t ask him, I just went to ask how was doing. He has issued a statement that ‘I will speak in January, so let us wait till January.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FpZmtoYmh6p63SoaalmV2nsrexwKWqZq%2BYmrtuwMinrJutXay2rbiMnZycpJGnsm6yzqtkqaqVqLalsc2csGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaun-dixon-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shaun Dixon - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
