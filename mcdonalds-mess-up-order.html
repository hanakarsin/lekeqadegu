And while it's easy to write off <a href=#>"hanger"</a> as a fake phenomenon and attribute it to a person's own inability to manage their emotions, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian Mag</a> says it's a very real phenomenon.</p><p>According to a survey that was conducted on 64 people who had their emotions tracked via a smartphone app, findings indicated that "hunger was associated with more anger and irritability and less pleasure—to a significant degree. After crunching the numbers, the researchers determined that hunger was responsible for 56 percent of participants’ varying feelings of irritability."</p><p>The outlet went on to state: "Past research has also linked low blood sugar with increased aggression, impulsivity and anger, as well as the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol."</p><p>While there are plenty of us who probably have tons of anecdotal evidence/experiences that can back this study up, it might provide comfort to some to know that there's some legitimate scientific research to back up their hunger/anger episodes.</p><p>And this TikToker's sad post could be yet another example.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jessicagardner585 href=#>@jessicagardner585</a><p>@McDonald’s i just wanna talk <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=mcdonalds href=#>#mcdonalds</a> <a title=ihateithere href=#>#ihateithere</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Jessica Gardner" href=#>♬ original sound - Jessica Gardner</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>In it, a user on the platform by the name of Jessica Gardner who posts under the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jessicagardner585</a> shares her story of an unfortunate experience she claims she had at a Mickey D's location.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>In the post she says, "I'm having a terrible day and so I got McDonald's before I went to work I got a burger they forgot to put the patty on it and you know what that's fine I got nuggets so I'll just eat the nuggets and maybe I didn't need the burger." She shows off the patty-less burger with a few bites taken out of it. Then she extricates the nuggets box from the bag.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>"So I go to open the nuggets...trying to open the box...it's an egg. Why. Why is there an egg in here?" She asks, seemingly fighting off tears. Breakfast has been over for two hours. I just wanted a meal before I go into work. I'm very upset," she says before the video cuts out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>Other TikTokers shared their own McDonald's order gaffes, while some people expressed sympathy with Jessica's experience, stating that if they were having a bad day too that this happening would ultimately send them over the edge.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>Jessica herself in the comments section said that "This sent me over the edge today."</p><p>"My heart felt for you girl!!!!"</p><p>"This would’ve been my 13th reason"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>Others took it as an opportunity to tell some jokes, quipping that they still technically fulfilled the "chicken" part of her chicken nuggets order.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>"I mean they technically still gave you chicken, just forgot to finish making it"</p><p>"They realllllly undercooked the chicken."</p><p>"I once ordered nuggets but it was a container full of pickles"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jessicagardner585</span></figure><p>So what was the cause of the gaffe? One TikToker offered up a practical hypothesis: that her order was probably mixed up with a vegetarian's order who wanted their cheeseburger patty replaced with a fried egg, and the employees boxed the egg separately for the individual to assemble themselves, creating an alternative protein paddy order.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforClu82ao52rXaKytL%2BMrqdmp6KZsrM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-egg-masked-singer.html><span>←</span><span>The Clues About The Egg on 'The Masked Singer' Seem to Point to an Olympian (REVEALED!)</span></a>
