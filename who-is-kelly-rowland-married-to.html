In the photos, which she also shared on Instagram, the former Destiny's Child member was wearing a flowing orange gown and a black crop top on the beach.</p><p>At first, Kelly was hesitant to share her pregnancy news amid a global. pandemic. "But you still want to remind people that life is important," she said. "And being able to have a child... I'm knocking at 40's door in February.

"We had been talking about it loosely, and then COVID happened, and we were just like, 'Let's see what happens,'" she said, but then said she got pregnant almost immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kelly rested during her first trimester.</h2><p>After discovering that she was pregnant, Kelly said that she felt exhausted and used her first trimester to rest. Kelly said that she also indulged in several cravings, including chocolate and peanut butter, over the course of this pregnancy. She's also done a lot of thinking about what it means to raise Black sons in America today.&nbsp;</p><p>She told Women's Health that she'd just put Titan, her son, to bed when she heard the news about George Floyd's death. "I got into the shower, and I had this real hard, ugly, deep cry," she explained. "Because I promised to protect my kid. That was the main thing I was thinking about: protecting this little innocence." Still, she remains optimistic about the future her children will inherit.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kelly and Tim use role-playing to keep their marriage fresh.</h2><p>Although they're currently waiting to welcome another child, Kelly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in May that she and Tim have gotten creative in order to keep their love life interesting. "As far as sex is concerned, I'm like, 'Well, if I have to play dress up and do role-play, honey, if I need to be Alicia tonight and give you a surprise in the middle of the night or something then it needs to happen. We spice things up a bit and keep it fun," Kelly said.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we met each other, we had fun," she continued. "Two years from now, we’ll have fun. I think if you hold that close to you, it can always show itself in your relationship.” Kelly continued, saying that owning your own sexuality is important, both as an artist and in a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKSdnKHGbr7OsKOappRiuqK%2B0aKcnWWkpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reece-king-html.html><span>←</span><span>Reece King - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
