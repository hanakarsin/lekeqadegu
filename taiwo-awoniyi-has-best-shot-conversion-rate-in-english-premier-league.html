In those minutes, the Nigeria international scored a total of 16 goals.</p><p>A report by Sky Sports confirmed that Awoniyi has a 28.6 percent shot conversion rate. While Manchester City forward, Erling Haaland has a 26.1 percent shot conversion rate.</p><p>The aforementioned strikers are closely followed by Callum Wilson of Newcastle United (24per percent), Diogo Jota of Liverpool (22.5 percent), and Ivan Toney of Brentford (21.4 percent).</p><p>Note that Haaland, seen as the best striker in the Premier League, currently has 52 goals across the two seasons, but that doesn’t mean he has the best shot-conversion rate in the league. When the number of games played is put side-by-side with the number of goals scored, Taiwo Awoniyi has been unstoppable this season and last season.</p><p>Recall that Awoniyi missed 11 league games last season due to injury issues, and <a href=# rel=noopener>he is on the verge of missing more games this season due to the same reason.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FqZq2Zmay8bq3WqKWisZlitaK%2FjJucrKxdqLWwwIycpqeulafAqrvNZqmarJVitq95xKeepaGjnXqxvsSmoJ6qXaGyorPUnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-okotie-begs-tinubu-atiku-to-step-down.html><span>←</span><span>Okotie Begs Tinubu, Atiku To Step Down</span></a>
