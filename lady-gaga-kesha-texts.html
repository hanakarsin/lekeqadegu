It looks like Kesha's devastating legal battle continues. You may recall when the &#34;Die Young&#34; singer charged 46-year-old music producer, Lucasz Gottwald, aka Dr. Luke, for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting her at a Los Angeles party back in 2005.&nbsp;
Dr. Luke, however, counter-sued the singer for defamation, claiming she was lying, in a failed attempt to get out of her contract."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Following a lengthy trial, Dr. Luke won.</p><p>Six years later, the 32-year-old pop queen was just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charged with defamation</a> — once again — regarding a series of texts that she reportedly sent to <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>.</p><p>So, what happens now, and what did Kesha's texts to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga </a>say? Is Kesha going to jail? Here's what you need to know regarding Kesha's legal battles.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Kesha's text to Lady Gaga say?</h2><p>On Thursday, Feb. 6, Kesha lost yet another lawsuit against Dr. Luke, over a private text message she reportedly sent to Lady Gaga back in 2016. In the text, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kesha alleged that she and Katy Perry were assaulted "by the same man,"</a> which referred to the music producer in question, according to Washington Post.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy apparently testified</a> in court, according to Vox, and apparently said she was not —&nbsp;in fact — raped by Dr. Luke... which would make the text in question "defamatory." New York Supreme Court Judge, Jennifer G. Schecter, ruled Kesha guilty, however, one would think Dr. Luke wouldn't be able to make a case since it was sent via private messaging.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Ke$ha and Katy Perry at The American Music Awards after party hosted by Rolling Stone held at The Rolling Stone Restaurant And Lounge on November 21, 2010 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Alexandra Wyman/WireImage)</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But is Kesha getting charged over a text message that was private?</h2><p>One thing that makes this case particularly strange is the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kesha's text to Lady Gaga was private</a> — she wasn't publicly accusing Dr. Luke of rape, so why is she getting charged over this? Apparently, according to Reason, the judge ruled "publication of a false statement to even one person, here Lady Gaga, is sufficient to impose liability."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Judge Jennifer Schecter also noted that Dr. Luke isn't a public figure, despite his high-profile job — if he were deemed a "public figure," the statements would have to be false and spread with "gross irresponsibility." The people Dr. Luke represents are public figures — he is not — and the texts were private, so they weren't meant to ruin his reputation.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Kesha going to jail?</h2><p>No, Kesha isn't going to jail, but she'll have to pay Dr. Luke $374,000 in interest on late royalty payments, as she continues fighting for justice in her original sexual assault case, according to The Hollywood Reporter. That's right — the "Die Young" singer is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still trying to get out of her contract</a>, despite the horrendous circumstances. Dr. Luke has maintained she's lied about the entire thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily though, Kesha has a huge support system — she's super <a href=#>close with her boyfriend</a>, and a number of celebrities have come out in support, from Ariana Grande to Lady Gaga, and Kelly Clarkson, according to Huffington Post, so if you've seen the hashtag #FreeKesha, that's why. It's a seriously devastating situation, and we're all rooting for Kesha.&nbsp;</p><p>The pop kween deserves the best.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My heart is with <a href=#>@KeshaRose</a>. 💜</p>— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) <a href=#>February 19, 2016</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There are people all over the world who love you <a href=#>@KeshaRose</a>.
