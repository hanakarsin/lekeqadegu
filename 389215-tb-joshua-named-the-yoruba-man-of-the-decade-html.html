According to him, the three personalities were chosen after discussions and a careful consideration of the role each had played in the modern Yoruba history.</p><p>Praising Pastor TB Joshua, Prince Adeleke said:</p><p><i>“He began his ministerial career at a swampy location in Ikotun Egbe, Lagos. Today, this ancestral origin of the Synagogue has transformed from a dingy wasteland into a local Disneyland drawing, in one year, millions of visitors to Nigeria from Africa, Europe, the Middle East and America.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Wole Soyinka Calls Jonathan And Buhari 'Problematic'</a></p><p>According to the Chairman, through tonnes of email correspondents sent to IrohinOdua, Pastor Joshua received commendations for his prominent services to mankind.</p><p><i>"We see in his handiwork, a quiet revolution to transform the world in ways unimaginable. Since we blew the whistle for nomination, we have received incalculable, baffling testimonials from royals and ordinary street folks leading us to a hidden light in a dark, malicious world where the poor remain the dreg and the end butt of repression, neglect and perpetual want,"</i> Adekele continued.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be noted that recently the Nigerian prophet has had not very good times as&nbsp;<a href=#>Lagos High Court slammed a&nbsp;substantial&nbsp;fine of N25,000</a> on the Synagogue Church&nbsp;Of All Nations and its founder.
