The first season was an important test to see if Bravo would be able to successfully reboot a tried and true Real Housewives franchise. The new cast of RHONY's reboot proved that it can work, and now some new ladies have joined the fray.</p><p>All the ladies from Season 14 have returned, including <a href=#>Jenna Lyons</a>, whom many were concerned would not come back to the franchise. There's also a new Housewife being thrown into the mix: model and art curator <a href=#>Racquel Chevremont</a>. Racquel joins the franchise as the second Real Housewife, alongside Jenna, who's a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Minkoff</a> also joins as a new friend of the Housewives, and she's got a pretty impressive net worth as well. So, what is Rebecca Minkoff's net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @rebeccaminkoff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rebecca Minkoff is joining 'The Real Housewives of New York' in a sriend role, but her net worth is impressive enough to be a full-time Housewife.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several sources</a>, Rebecca's net worth sits at a very healthy $10 million. As a designer, she has her own line of accessories and other items. She and co-founder, Uri Minkoff, initially ran the company themselves until the COVID-19 pandemic shut the entire world down. The financial difficulties the company faced because of the pandemic led them to later sell it to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunrise Brands</a>, who own it as a parent company. Rebecca still has creative control as the Chief Creative Officer.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Rebecca Minkoff</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Fashion designer, Business owner, and TV personality</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $10 million</p><p>Rebecca Minkoff is a world-renowned fashion designer based in New York City.
