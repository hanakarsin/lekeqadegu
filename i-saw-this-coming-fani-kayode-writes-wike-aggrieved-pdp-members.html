According to him, the politicians are being treated like filth by their own party.</p><p>FFK who claimed he had foreseen the happening events in the PDP camp, said Wike and his aggrieved faction members had no choice but to pull out of Atiku Abubakar’s campaign camp.</p><p>He said: “Yet I saw all this coming long ago.&nbsp;Why do you think I left the PDP in the first place? It is a party that is no longer national and does not even pretend to have respect for Southerners.</p><p>“It is a party that is incapable of rewarding loyalty and keeping its word. It is a party that begins and ends in the North and every Southerner and Middle Belter that is still there is nothing but a quisling and a stooge.</p><p>“It is a party that does not believe in or understand the importance of building bridges of peace, love and understanding between the North and the South and ensuring fairness, justice and equity for all.</p><p>“It is a party that does nothing but insult and seek to marginalise and destroy it’s perceived detractors and enemies and putting Nigeria in its hands would mean the end of our country within a matter of months.”</p><p>FFK berated the opposition party, saying this was not the PDP of former presidents; Chief <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Olusegun Obasanjo</strong></a>, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua or Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.</p><p>“This is a dying and decaying fly and maggot-infested carcass and a pitiful shadow and shell of its former self,”&nbsp;the APC chieftain remarked.</p><p>He added: “A party with no morals or decency that treats those that stood by it, helped it and fought for it over the years with contempt and disdain. A party that uses and dumps.</p><p>“A party that seeks to deride, misrepresent and humiliate all those that once stood in the trenches with them and fought fir their cause. A party which has close and covert links with the terrorists that are killing, maiming and kidnapping our people.</p><p>“A party which is powered and controlled by hidden forces that believe they own Nigeria and that have not only sought to destabilise our nation but have also unleashed murder, mayhem, hell and terror against our people. A party that does not want peace but delights in conflict, rancour, division, hegemony and war.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FsZqJlo5bEbsDHoqpmm5%2Bitq%2BzjJ%2BYp6FdoK66u8OeZLCqmamytHnWoqKeZZGctLO1xK%2BcnWWgmb1uucSmmZ6qo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./koala-man-voice-actors.html><span>←</span><span>Get to Know the Voice Actors in 'Koala Man' on Hulu</span></a>
