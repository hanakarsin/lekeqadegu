Unfortunately, he got injured and had to be forced off in the 81st minute of the encounter.</p><p>At the time of writing this report, Luton Town had yet to announce the severity of the injury. Hence, it is still uncertain if the defender will play for Nigeria in the international friendlies against Ghana on March 22 and Mali on March 26 at the Grand Stade de Marrakech in Morocco.</p><p>Note that Gabriel Osho, who joined Luton Town on November 18, 2020, after spending about three months without a club, was part of the team that helped Luton gain promotion to the Premier League last season.</p><p>Since joining the club, Osho has made 80 appearances in all competitions, in which he has scored five goals and provided one assist. The centre-back has scored two Premier League goals so far this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BqZqWtpKS7bsDOsKWsZZeWr7O1xKVkqKuYpHqurdhmpaisXaKurLGMoaCsZaOqvaa%2BjJ6YoKSVqHqlscGuq2ahnmK6or7CoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-tom-koracick-going-to-die.html><span>←</span><span>Is Tom Koracick Going to Die?
