I have my own children and they are very strong in that regard too. I am not one to be involved in politics. But you see, not all your children are bound to follow you,” he said.</p><p>“One of my sons, who incidentally is an actor, has decided that he wants to be a politician. Most of the youngsters have been bugging my phone asking me to endorse my son that they want him as president and l get amused. But they keep insisting daddy, we want Yul to be the president of this country.</p><p>“We like him. He is disciplined, sympathetic, he believes a lot in people. They have bothered me so much that today, I’m hereby present him to you. He has my blessing. He has my endorsement.</p><p>“Any day he decides to veer off from the discipline under which he was raised, l will withdraw him from the race. It shall be well with you son. Since it has been your ambition to go into politics and the desire to run for the presidency of this country, may the good Lord assist you, protect and direct you.”</p><p>Meanwhile, former Vice President <strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong> is facing a legal hurdle seeking to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>disqualify him from presenting himself as a candidate for the 2023 presidential election</a></strong> in Nigeria.</p><p>A group, identified as the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa has approached the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking an order to stop Atiku from contesting future presidential elections in Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5BvZmtoYmh6qnnWoqOlZZKaerW0xGaZnqukYr2zsdKim56mpGK7qrPEq6CaZZiWwG6x1Z6pZqCRmXq6wctmnJ2nk522pnnBqJisrKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./portable.html><span>←</span><span>Portable News | Latest news about Portable today, 8 January 2024</span></a>
