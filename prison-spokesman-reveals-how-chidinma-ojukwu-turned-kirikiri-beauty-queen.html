Some could be recreational activities, some could be theatre work like entertainment.</p><p>“There are a number of programs that we introduced to get the inmates happy and put them in a good frame of mind. First, we ensure that while they are there, they are open to correction, second, we ensure that they are there in good spirit in order to help them kill boredom.</p><p>“There are so many things we do. In line with this, the officer in charge of the Kirikiri correctional facility organized some competitions among the inmates like cooking, tailoring, make-up, among others.</p><p>“These are things that will make them happy because our primary responsibility is to keep them safe and sound. That was what happened and she emerged the best in the competition. It is part of what we do.
