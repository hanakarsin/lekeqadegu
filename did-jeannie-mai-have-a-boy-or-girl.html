I was like, 'I know exactly what I want, and I know exactly what kind of woman I want to be,' and I always said I'd never be a mom," the host said. "There are so many reasons now that are coming to fruition as to why I would have said that then, but I do know that you never say never and that love can really change you."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeannie and Jeezy have yet to share further details about the sex of the newborn baby.</h2><p>Curious fans will be disappointed to know that certain details about the baby, like their name and sex, are still unknown to the public.
