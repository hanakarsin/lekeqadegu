The opportunity? The chance to audition for Lee Daniels for a role in Empire.</p><p>“My first opportunity on TV was Empire,” Serayah exclusively told Distractify. “I got a call from my long time friend Dejaun Butler referring me to an audition for the role of Tiana.”</p><p>From there, the rest was history, which is something Serayah is forever grateful for.</p><p>“I feel extremely blessed that I had a goal in mind, kept my head down, worked really hard, and then preparation met opportunity,” Serayah told us.
