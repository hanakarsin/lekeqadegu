You’re gonna see it. It’s so evil. It’s crazy how mean people are.”</p><p>But the 18-time Teen Choice Award winner also told host Ryan Seacrest how she flipped the script.&nbsp;</p><p>“I posted this photo on Instagram, and I was like, ‘There’s more to love. I’m happy with myself.’ And the reason why I did that is because I didn’t want them to win. Because then, the next day, it wasn’t about how I gained weight, it was about how I embraced it, and that’s just kind of my approach.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbsPEop6hrF2crqq6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-accuses-dbanj-of-rape.html><span>←</span><span>Man Accuses DBanj Of Rape</span></a>
