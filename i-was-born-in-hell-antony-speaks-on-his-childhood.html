That’s not a joke. For my European friends who don’t know, the favela where I grew up in São Paulo is actually called Inferninho — “little hell.”</p><p>“It is an infamous place. Fifteen steps from our front door, there were always drug dealers doing their business, passing stuff hand-to-hand. The smell was constantly outside our window.”</p><p>The Manchester United winger was born and raised in Brazil and joined the So Paulo academy at the age of 10 where he remained for eight years.</p><p>“Every day, my older brother would take me to the square to play football. In the favela, everyone plays. Kids, old men, teachers, construction workers, bus drivers, drug dealers, gangsters. There, everyone is equal,” continued the Brazilian.</p><p>“I was small, but I dribbled with a meanness that came from God. Dribbling was always something inside me. It was a natural instinct. And I refused to bow my head to anyone. I would elastico the drug dealers. Rainbow the bus drivers. Nutmeg the thieves. I really did not give a f***.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BuZqJlp5bAbq7Oq6VmoZ5itaa4y2aYp6yfo8Zuv8%2BemKSrXaS7brTIrGScoJmhsam7zp1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-prayed-for-covid-19-not-to-end-says-apostle-suleman-as-he-buys-3rd-jet.html><span>←</span><span>'I Prayed For COVID-19 Not To End'</span></a>
