It is a combination of the over 200,000 votes from Rivers who supported the man who is our President today.”</p><p>He further questioned Wike’s direct involvement, saying, “I can’t remember any forum when he referred to the candidate of our party. He did not direct his people to vote for him, to my knowledge. So I don’t know what Okocha means by Wike immensely contributing to Tinubu’s Victory.”</p><p>Wokocha believes that it’s crucial to thank the people of Rivers and those who campaigned to convince voters that Tinubu was a superior candidate.</p><p>Although Wokocha is not against Wike joining the APC, he affirms that the party is not in search of a leader.</p><p>He underlines, “Candidly speaking politics is the more the merrier. So Wike coming to the APC is a welcome development.”</p><p>However, he takes issue with the notion of Wike taking control of the party, calling it an aberration.</p><p>He reminded listeners of Wike’s past criticism of the APC, stating, “It was the same Wike who said APC is cancer stage four and the PDP is malaria. But he is welcome if he has suddenly realized that our cancer is better than malaria he is suffering from.”</p><p>Wokocha asserts that it would be a disservice to Rivers State citizens if Wike were to lead the APC there.</p><p>According to him, the APC has adequate leadership, including Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and himself.</p><p>Finally, while appreciating the work done by President Bola Tinubu, Wokocha insisted, “But nobody should take credit that is not his own and take claims that are not theirs. We won’t allow such misleading of our people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FsZrChm5p6r7vTZqquoaSWr62xjK2mZqSVlrFurc%2BcZKKmXae2t7HRrGSwp5uksKmtjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wayne-rooney-tells-rashford-what-to-do-to-attain-mbappe-and-haalands-level.html><span>←</span><span>Wayne Rooney Tells Rashford What To Do To Attain Mbappe And Haaland's level</span></a>
