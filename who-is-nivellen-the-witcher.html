While many familiar faces return to our screen, including <a href=#>Geralt of Rivia</a> (<a href=#>Henry Cavill</a>), <a href=#>Yennefer of Vengerberg</a> (Anya Chalotra), <a href=#>Princess "Ciri" Cirilla</a> (Freya Allan), and <a href=#>Jaskier (Joey Batey)</a>, several new characters arrive at the scene for Season 2.</p><p>Based on Andrzej Sapkowski's first Witcher novel, Blood of Elves, Season 2 of the Netflix series adds Geralt's mentor Vesemir and three additional witchers — Lambert, Coën, and Eskel.</p><p>However, the most notable character many are looking forward to seeing in the live-action television show is Nivellen, played by Game of Thrones alum <a href=#>Kristofer Hivju</a>. Before heading into Season 2, let's learn a bit about Nivellen's character.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Nivellen in 'The Witcher'?</h2><p>First off, let's make things clear — Nivellen's character arc and storyline in The Witcher franchise clearly take inspiration from Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve's classic fairy tale, Beauty and the Beast. As a whole, Nivellen is very similar to Prince Adam, better known as the "Beast," as they both receive a curse that alters their physicality into that of a monstrous creature.</p><p>OK, now we can get into what Nivellen is all about in The Witcher franchise. Geralt first encounters Nivellen in Andrzej Sapkowski's short story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"A Grain of Truth"</a> from The Last Wish. After following a trail of bodies, Geralt arrives at an estate that just so happens to be Nivellen's residence.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Though Nivellen initially tries to scare Geralt away, the two connect once Geralt learns Nivellen can speak quite well, despite his beastly appearance. Nivellen invites Geralt in for a chat, and he tells the Witcher all about his curse — how it came about and how Nivellen has attempted to break it for several years with no luck.</p><p>Nivellen also tells Geralt about the previous women living in his home — Fenne, Primula, Ilka, and Venimira — but he doesn't say much about his latest companion despite Geralt's interrogation.</p><p>Then, once Geralt leaves for a bit, Nivellen's most recent lover arrives, and she's a <a href=#>Bruxa</a> named Vereena. As we all know, Bruxae are quite dangerous creatures, and she manages to lure Geralt into a battle. Eventually, Nivellen interferes with their fight, which leads to Vereena's death.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>peep this new look at Kristofer Hivju's THE WITCHER Season 2 character, Nivellen <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XwNWoEdlkH</a></p>— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href=#>September 25, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Even though Nivellen loses his lover, her love blended with her blood lifts his curse, and he is a man once again. We think he should be happy, seeing as Vereena attempted to kill him mere seconds before her death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kristofer Hivju portrays Nivellen in 'The Witcher' Season 2.</h2><p>Attention all Tormund Giantsbane fans — Kristofer Hivju is portraying Nivellen in Season 2 of The Witcher. The 43-year-old star is best known for his work on <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>, but others may also know him as Connor Rhodes in The Fate of the Furious.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kristofer Hivju (@khivju)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He's unrecognizable in The Witcher, but his talents and skills as an actor shape him into one of the best new additions in the series.
