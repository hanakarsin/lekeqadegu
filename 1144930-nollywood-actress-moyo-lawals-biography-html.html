Fans of Moyo Lawal were left to wonder if the notable actress really has a low self-esteem which she covers with confident photos and direct interviews or she is just speaking this way to get more compliments. Either way, Moyo Lawal is a really mysterious person, and the sassy passionate woman we usually see in the interviews might not be the real her at all. As we have already seen, she has an insecure and vulnerable side that she tries to reveal only to her family and closest friends.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt1jre9aefclbg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sensational young actress Lota Chukwu: 9 things you wanted to know about her!</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5i9selmo5a3.jpeg><p class=align-left>You have found out more about the inspirational Nollywood actress Moyo Lawal.
