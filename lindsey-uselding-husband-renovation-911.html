Let's just get into it!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is 'Renovation 911' co-host Lindsey Uselding's husband?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@lindsey.uselding</a></figure><p>Co-host Lindsey is married to Nate Uselding. He is currently a second grade teacher at Delano Elementary and has been since 2014. Before that, Nate was a stay at home dad! We love to see it!</p><p>Nate received his Bachelor of Science in Turf and Turfgrass Management from the University of Wisconsin. He also has a Bachelors in Elementary Education from the University of Bemidji, and his Masters of Education from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nate Uselding (@nate_uselding)</a></p></figure><p>On Lindsey and Nate's anniversary, he posted this tribute to his wife that said, "Happy Anniversary Lindsey! You’re the love of my life and I can’t imagine a day without you! You are the best! Thank you for making me who I am and being an amazing wife and mother!"</p><p>Lindsey and Nate have two beautiful girls, Alivia and Braylin. Although their ages are unknown, Alivia appears to be in high school and Braylin appears to be in middle school.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nate Uselding (@nate_uselding)</a></p></figure><p>Nate sweetly posted this tribute to his family that said, "So much energy, so many emotions. I am so proud of all of you! Thank you for trusting me to be your Dad, coach, teacher, and husband!"</p><p>It's amazing that Nate is so supportive of his family, since Lindsey must be super busy. In addition to filming her own HGTV show, Renovation 911, with her sister Kirsten, the sisters also have their own company, Practical Home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Practical Home | Kirsten and Lindsey (@practicalhomeofficial)</a></p></figure><p>According to the company's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, "Our innovative savvy solutions offer strong visual impact and even greater protection against the biggest home safety concerns. We’re all about keeping you and your family safe with beautiful design that protects against the unexpected." The site seems to be a blog and there's also <a href=#>merchandise for sale</a>, which is very cute we must say.</p><p>In addition to everything else the sisters have going on, Lindsey and Kirsten both are part owners of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ungerman</a>, a company that does emergency mitigation and restoration services. So, it's safe to say that Lindsey and Kirsten know what they're doing.</p><p>Make sure to tune into Renovation 911 on HGTV on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobavsNKesGato5q5pbXNoGShraOXrq%2BwjKucp6emlsGqu81mcGpp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-we-didnt-endorse-atiku-anambra-traditional-rulers.html><span>←</span><span>2023: We Didn't Endorse Atiku</span></a>
