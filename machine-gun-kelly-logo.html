"Homie we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive / F--king dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside."&nbsp;</p><p>The back-and-forth battle continued with Eminem releasing “Kill Shot,” which was solely directed at MGK. “But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?" he sang.</p><p>Following the release, the rapper opened up to Sway Calloway about the beef, explaining, "The reason that I dissed [Kelly] is because he got on. First what he said, 'I'm the greatest rapper alive since my favorite rapper banned me from Shade 45,' or whatever he said, right? Like, I'm trying to hinder his career. I don't give a f--k about your career."</p><p>He continued, “Now I'm in this f--king weird thing because I'm like, I have to answer this motherf--ker, and every time I do that, it makes that person — as irrelevant as people say I am in hip-hop, I make them bigger by getting into this thing.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Last September, MGK told The Breakfast Club that he wasn’t really fazed by Eminem’s comments or diss track. "You want to talk about man buns?" he questioned. "You want to talk about a hairstyle I wore for a movie, a blockbuster movie, shout-out Nerve, and a 10-episode Showtime series called Roadies? I'm an actor, homie. How disconnected are you?"</p><p>Well, it’s safe to say it seems this feud will never die.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6ktMinnGafpaN6rLHLpbBmpJ%2BcvA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luton-towns-gabriel-osho-may-not-make-his-super-eagles-debut-in-march.html><span>←</span><span>Luton Town's Gabriel Osho May Not Make His Super Eagles Debut In March</span></a>
