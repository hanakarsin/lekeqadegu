It is just to take another look at the campaign list so people don’t complain again. That’s the agenda of the meeting.”</p><p>However, the National Chairman of the party, <strong>Abdullahi Adamu</strong> and other members of the NWC were absent from the meeting of the strategic planning committee.</p><p>The source when asked if NWC members were expected to be present in the meeting said unless an arrangement was agreed on, they also held sensitive positions in the newly constituted campaign council.</p><p>He said, “Are they not members of the PCC? Remember that Adamu is a deputy chairman of the council while national vice chairmen of the APC are equally deputy coordinators and zonal vice chairmen.</p><p>“But many of them were absent at the meeting.
