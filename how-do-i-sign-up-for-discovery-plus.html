Given other new streaming services launched without access to Roku or Amazon Fire TV, with Discovery Plus being easily accessed across several devices, it makes the whole sign-up process way easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To sign up for Discovery Plus, users should visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discoveryplus.com</a> and click the option for "Start Free Trial." This will give full access to Discovery Plus for a full seven days, allowing you to try it out before making a commitment to pay for it. &nbsp;</p><p>From there, you have to choose a plan from the two tiers available. The first plan is $4.99 a month which will include advertisements. The second tier, which is ad-free, will cost $6.99 a month. After selecting the pay plan, click continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The next step will require you to create a username and password. Once you have that settled and chosen, click "agree and continue," so to signal that you agree with the service's terms and conditions. You'll then be asked to add in your payment information. It's important to note that after the seven-day free trial, if you don't cancel before then, you'll be charged for the next month. After that, click "agree and continue" one final time.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You're done and ready good to start browsing all the titles that come with Discovery Plus, which includes a library of both content we already love and new original content.
