Visualize the worst-case scenario</h3><p class=align-left>In some cases, the worst-case scenario may be genuinely disastrous, and it may be perfectly rational to fear failure.

That way, you will develop the mindset that undesirable outcomes are opportunities to learn and get better.</p><h3>6. Be kind to yourself</h3><p class=align-left>A big part of why we are scared of failing can be due to our lack of confidence, or a strong desire for perfection. You should always try and treat yourself as kindly as you can.</p><p class=align-left>Treat yourself with sympathy and understand why you are feeling a certain way.</p><h3>7. Learn from your past</h3><p class=align-left>Learning from your past is also a great way to change your mindset and face your fears once again.

Be more optimistic</h3><p class=align-left>Positive thinking is an incredibly powerful way to build self-confidence and neutralize self-sabotage.</p><h3>10. Analyze all possible outcomes</h3><p class=align-left>This can help you put things into perspective and see that failing is not the worst thing that can happen.</p><h3>11. Expose yourself to failure</h3><p class=align-left>Try something new that you are unskilled in and may make mistakes in too.
