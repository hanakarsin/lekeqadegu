Michael told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> back in 2016 that filming The Light Between Oceans had nothing to do with how he felt about Alicia, saying, "It wasn’t the first time in a movie either of us had played somebody who is falling in love. There is an element of separation there. If I’m playing a murderer, I don’t go out and start murdering people."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Alicia added, "And I think we’ve made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us.

But there are times that myself or colleagues have been through something and, well, I can't understand how they went on to the red carpet afterward."</p><p>Alicia felt it was important to talk about her own challenges with fertility before giving birth to her son so that other women going through similar situations felt less alone.</p><p>Michael and Alicia have not publicly confirmed the name of their son.
