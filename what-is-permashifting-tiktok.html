This has become such a trend that people sometimes refer to learning things on <a href=#>TikTok</a> as “TikTok University.” Others say they “read an article,” which is often code for watching a TikTok video. One of the latest practices to circulate on <a href=#>TikTok is shifting</a>, which has a more extreme version called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">permashifting</a>.</p><p>Shifting is a practice of shifting from one reality to another, popularized on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#ShiftTok</a>, although it has also been circulating throughout Tumblr and Reddit. Now, shifting has shifted from TikTok to Twitter as it becomes even more popular, and millennials have some opinions about it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Permashifting is a “permanent” practice of shifting realities.</h2><p>The idea of shifting gained popularity during COVID-19, when TikTok grew alongside feelings of despair, isolation, and disappointment in the current reality. It would also be remiss to say that the <a href=#>MCU’s</a> dedication to the multiverse didn’t play a part in the practice of shifting. Basically, TikTokers popularized the idea that by writing a script for one’s “desired reality” (DR), they could shift between their “current reality” (CR) and their DR.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In doing so, however, they’re leaving their CR behind to make a better life for themselves in their DR. Examples of DRs include going to Hogwarts to date Draco Malfoy, going into favorite anime worlds, and just being a different version of oneself. Permashifting refers to going to one’s DR “permanently,” although it really just means long term, as one can always return to their “original reality” (OR).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>For people who are going to come across this and be like “what the fuck is shifting”, first of all, I am sorry that you had to learn about something this insane today.</p><p>“Shifters” believe that you can send your consciousness to any reality you want. Because they’re infinite, that…</p>— ivy (@ivy_wylder) <a href=#>December 12, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The idea of shifting is that there's an infinite amount of realities based on the choices and experiences in our lives. If we want to change to a reality in which one chooses to do gymnastics instead of theater, one would map out what that DR looks like and then shift to that reality.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are many ways to shift from CR to DR, but the practice is also very controversial.</h2><p>To achieve shifting, TikTokers have shared techniques, such as the Raven Method, which incorporates lying in a starfish position and counting to 100 while listening to “subliminals.” Subliminals are often pre-recorded audio and video, typically available on YouTube, SoundCloud, and other platforms, that layer DR affirmations (“I can shift my consciousness to the reality I desire whenever I want to”) over ambient music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Other popular shifting methods include the Alice in Wonderland Method, the Pillow Method, the Elevator Method, the Lifa App (a DR app), and the Void State Method, all of which were popularized on TikTok and Reddit. These are all essentially high-focus meditations that help shifters transcend their CR into their DR.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, many outsiders see shifting as a trauma response. In some ways, it can be very healthy, and several psychologists say that there’s no harm to shifting temporarily. “Holding on to the idea that no matter how bad the world may feel around us, we have the ability, skill, and permission to be whatever we want by experiencing it internally can bring great hope in times of great distress,” Dr. Joshua Kaplow told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In many ways, shifting is simply a way to reframe reality and deal with past traumas or experiences. By outlining a DR and shifting into it, shifters are achieving a form of manifestation, which millennials have been practicing for ages. Shifting is also likened to millennia-old practices of storytelling, daydreaming, and other forms of changing how we respond to our circumstances.</p><p>On the flip side, however, permashifting can have lasting and damaging effects. Some shifters might bank so heavily on entering a new reality that they detach from their CR and become disengaged, failing to perform basic functions like caring for personal hygiene and health. Another downside is that it can create unrealistic expectations — some people create unhealthy visual appearances for their DR, such as a perfect hourglass figure, that isn’t attainable no matter what.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>romanticizing schizophrenia is so gen z coded omfg</p>— Ksana (@bigarms4me) <a href=#>December 12, 2023</a></figure><p>While the idea of shifting can be fun, it gets dangerous to oneself when thinking about it as permanent and 100 percent realistic. This is why someone on Twitter called it, “TikTok-induced schizophrenia.” The idea that one can actually shift between realities in which their body, face, and environment are completely different can be tied to mental health challenges.</p><p>So, shift away! But remember that permashifting isn’t always the best way to deal with problems in the CR.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmaolae6or%2FHop2toZ6cerW1yq2mpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-thursday-29th-june-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Thursday, 29th June, 2023</span></a>
