Everybody today knows that things are not what they should be in Nigeria and we have to get it right in 2023. If we get it wrong in 2023, it would be very bad for the country, so, we have to get it right.”</p><p>He stated that the PDP must look for competence and someone who has capacity in the knowledge of what it means to serve or lead this country.</p><p>“We are on the wrong road and we cannot continue this journey on this road. So, if the chairman comes from one zone, it would not stop people from the other zone from contesting,” the former governor said.</p><p>“We are dealing with something that can be moved from one zone to the other. I can tell you that 2023 would be totally different because everybody is struggling to make sure that we do not get it wrong. I cannot determine where the zoning would go but we would wait and see, then we would look into it.”</p><p>Peter Obi however stated that if the PDP decides to zone to the north, he cannot speak for any state in the South East on how they would vote.</p><p>He added that, “I know that the southern governors have said the presidency should go to the South and that includes the South East. The South East as a zone has said it wants inclusion in Nigeria to show that it is part of it.</p><p>“The demand of the South East is genuine and compelling but we would have to watch what would happen. We have to consult, negotiate and make people understand what the issues are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FqZrCgkal6uLXLpWSdnaSav661zZ5ksKCfYrSmwNJmp52oXaW%2Fpr%2FInZynrJmWuW7AyJyinqxdm7yzeZFpaWxloJrBpr6MqJmiZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-dhar-mann-actors.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to the Actors in YouTuber Dhar Mann's Videos?</span></a>
