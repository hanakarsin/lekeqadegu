She stated that Naira was putting drugs in their food, and She called herself a mother. She never came out to fight for her children then…maybe she just cooked up this lie to implicate Naira.</p><p>“Why was her daughter laced with drugs if she was not into drugs already? Which mother will keep quiet in such a situation? The NDLEA and the police heard what she said and they are keeping mute. How will this country get better? I expect The NDLEA to invite her to bring her children and investigate her”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49wZqKxkZe8brvJqGSjraOpeqS7zqScnWWlpXqttcRmq6hlmaK9rbXCmqueZZ6WtrOtjKaYq6SVrnq6u8yiZJ%2BZkp7GqnnApaOen5WofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mohammed-al-maktoum-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
