If you're comfortable baking in front of a camera, and if you think you have what it takes to win (and most importantly, impress Paul Hollywood), here's how to send in your application.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Applying for the show is simple.</h2><p>ABC recently announced they are currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accepting applications for The Great American Baking Show,</a> Season 6, according to Travel + Leisure, and if you have anyone (or even yourself) in mind, you'll be happy to know that applying is simple. Applications are required to fill out <a href=# title="(opens new window)" rel="noopener noreferrer">a form</a>, which has 75 questions in total.</p><p>The form starts out asking for personal information (including your name, place of residence, and occupation), before it goes into slightly deeper questions pertaining to your baking experience. From baking inspirations, to "signature dishes," and past kitchen disasters, the form is chock-full of in-depth baking questions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Once you've filled out the questions, there are a few more things they'll need.</h2><p>After completing the form, applicants are required to send in a photo of themselves, as well as some good old #FoodPorn to show off your homemade goodies. After uploading said photos, applicants are also required to make a two-minute video vouching for themselves as a worthwhile applicant. Just remember to smile, and to be personable.</p><p>Applicants that are truly amateur bakers (meaning they don't bake professionally), are at least 18 years of age or older, and a U.S. resident, will definitely be valid candidates. The application deadline is Friday, Feb. 28, so start prepping your answers now.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Last season was truly epic.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great American Baking Show, Season 5,</a> wrapped at the beginning of January 2020, and it was truly worth watching. The season was entirely holiday themed —&nbsp;deemed "Holiday Edition — and featured former Spice Girls pop star, Emma Bunton, as well as former NFL player, Anthony "Spice" Adams as hosts.</p><p>As per usual, The Great British Baking Show's Paul Hollywood judged, as well as pasty kween Sherry Yard. The host has not been confirmed for this upcoming season, but my money's on Mel B, whom you most likely know as Scary Spice. She's truly as spicy as they come.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Whether you decide to send out the application form to your BFF or you fill it out for yourself is entirely up to you.
