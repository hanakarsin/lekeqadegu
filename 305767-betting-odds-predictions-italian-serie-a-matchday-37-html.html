All the league fixtures have been exhilarating with teams displaying prowess and exceptional talent.

The league leaders were humiliated to a 2-0 loss at the Stadio Olimpico while both Napoli and Inter Milan rose to a step higher. The top four lineups were upheld as all the teams including Napoli, Inter Milan, and Atalanta walked away with three points from their matches. Further, the top five and six positions did not change with both AC Milan and Roma edging out their competitors and emerging the winners.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7b15b3d3d94c2047.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>French Ligue 1 matchday 1: Betting odds, picks, correct score predictions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At the relegation zone, Chievo and Frosinone were officially given a send-off as they both fell in the hands of their competitors. This weekend, the action is back and is more invigorated. Atalanta will be facing league leaders and champions, Juventus, while Napoli will square it out against league rivals Inter Milan.

The tips are a product of our expert analysis based on team performances over the past five to ten matches, history of the teams, their current form, and their targets for the balance of the season.</p><h3>1. Udinese Vs SPAL</h3><p class=align-left>Udinese was once again on the winning end of the league after a 1-3 victory over Frosinone. Unlike all the other winnings that were experienced over the eventful weekend, Udinese’s triumph was a life-changing experience. For them, it was the pass mark out of the relegation zone. They have won only one in their last five fixtures and will be seeking to extend their survival in the remaining two matches. SPAL, on the other hand, lost their last fixture but have had a fairly good run with two wins in the last five matches and one draw. From our analysis, SPAL are the favourites and will walk away with three points.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>German Bundesliga matchday 34: betting odds, picks, correct score and predictions</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>SPAL to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>0 – 1</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Serie A giants finally complete the signing of Chelsea superstar</p><h3>2. Genoa Vs Cagliari</h3><p class=align-left>Both Genoa and Cagliari fell in their last match but scored a goal. Come this weekend, and the two teams will be facing off against each other at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Genoa is only one point above the almost relegated Empoli and has a chance to redeem themselves from being relegated. They have lost three of their last five matches and drawn two. They have had a poor win record and show no potential of returning to winning ways anytime soon. On the other hand, Cagliari is comfortably at the twelfth position, far from the relegation scare.</p><p class=align-left>They have won only one of their last five fixtures and lost their last three consecutive fixtures. Coming to this match, they hope to walk away with all the three points despite the defensive nature of their opponents. From our correct score calculator, the two teams will end up in a goal-goal outcome.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fcd9a8ec47713705.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of EPL top scorers for 2018/2019</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 1</p><h3>3. Sassuolo Vs Roma</h3><p class=align-left>Sassuolo succumbed to Torino’s pressure, narrowly losing 3-2 after Mehdi Bourabia was sent away for a bad tackle. Their loss saw them stick at position 10 and seven points behind Sampdoria. They have won only one of their last five fixtures, losing one and drawing thrice. They will not be competing for anything for the rest of the league since they are far from the top four and the Europa League qualifiers.</p><p class=align-left>Roma, on the other hand, are coming to this match in a blaze after silencing the league leaders and current defending champions, Juventus, 0-2. They will need to triumph in this match and assure themselves a chance to play in Champions league come next season. They are currently sixth behind AC Milan and only two points above Torino. In our free exact score tips, we advise you to select a win for Roma and a 1-3 score.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Italian Serie A fixture: Week 36 score predictions</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Roma to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 3</p><h3>4. Chievo Vs Sampdoria</h3><p class=align-left>Chievo lost to Inter Milan by 2-0 while playing away and finalized their relegation possibilities. Chievo has had the worst season run, with three losses in their last five matches, winning only once and drawing one time. Sampdoria, on the other hand, are currently at position nine and will be seeking to remain the top ten mark afloat. They have won only one of their last five fixtures, and have not won any match in their last three fixtures. Both teams have a poor trend in their latest fixtures, but Sampdoria is better placed to triumph in this match.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Sampdoria to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 0 – 2</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Italian Serie A giants plot surprise winter transfer move for Chelsea superstar</p><h3>5. Parma Vs Fiorentina</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Today matches predictions - German Bundesliga odds and prediction for matchday 33</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Both Parma and Fiorentina lost their last match. Bologna were the favourites as they thrashed fifteenth place Parma 4-1 and ensured a winless run for Parma in the last five matches. The Duchy men are just three points above Empoli who are currently facing relegation. This means that Parma is equally at the risk of finding themselves in the relegation end if they lose all their remaining matches. Fiorentina, on the other hand, is at position 14 with 40 points. They are merely two points above Parma, and a loss may sink them closer to the bottom of the table. They have lost all their last four matches, and have no win in their last five fixtures. Our exact score tips advise a 0-0 score for this match.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>0 – 0</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7b15b3d3d94c2047.jpeg><h3>6. Empoli Vs Torino</h3><p class=align-left>Empoli is currently position 18 after 36 matches. They are sitting at the relegation section of the table and may likely drop to the Serie B. A win for them will steer them off the relegation scene. Unfortunately, the team has not won any game in their last five fixtures. Torino, on the other hand, is seventh and are eyeing a possible chance to play in the Europa league come next season. They have 60 points and have not lost in any of their last five fixtures, and a win will steer them up to the table. From our analysis, Torino is the favourites in this match and will take home all three points.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Spain World Cup squad 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Torino to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 1 – 3</p><h3>7. AC Milan Vs Frosinone</h3><p class=align-left>Milan won 0-1 in their last away fixture and climbed closer to the top four. Another victory will steer them closer to Atalanta, who is currently at position four. In the previous five matches, Milan has won three, lost one and drawn only one. As they welcome their opponents this weekend, they will be seeking to walk away with all points. On the other hand, Frosinone is at the relegation hotbed and have no chance of redeeming themselves. They are at 24 points, eleven behind Empoli, with only two matches remaining. Our expert correct score prediction is a win in favour of Milan.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Milan to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>3 – 0</p><h2>8. Juventus Vs Atalanta</h2><p class=align-left>Juventus have confirmed champions of the Serie A in the 2018/2019 season. They are currently at 89 points with two matches remaining. Last weekend, they were punished by Roma with a 2-0 loss, which may be the outcome this weekend also. Their laxity is a result of their championship status and has nothing more to fight for.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Atalanta is aggressively trying to remain in the top four, ahead of the 2019/2020 season and get a chance of playing in the champions league. Their victory over Genoa last weekend was evidence of their ability to win and will seek to extend their winning streak. From our prediction standpoint, Atalanta is the favourites in this fixture.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Atalanta to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 2</p><h3>9. Napoli Vs Inter Milan</h3><p class=align-left>After winning 1-2 against SPAL, Napoli is back in action as they welcome their stubborn rivals, Inter Milan. The Blues are currently second on the Serie A table behind Juventus with 76 points. They are also 10 points above their competitors Milan. After five last fixtures, Napoli has won four and lost only one. They are also enjoying a three-match winning streak which they seek to extend in the remaining fixtures. Milan, on the other hand, is third and face the threat of getting ousted from the top four.</p><p class=align-left>Their closest competitors Atalanta are at 65 points and a higher goal difference of 29 against Milan’s 26. Inter have not lost in their last five fixtures and will be seeking to extend their unbeaten run for the rest of the season. Our sure win prediction is a draw between the two giants, but a goal-goal outcome is also a most likely outcome.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 1</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Former Italian Serie A star winger dies in a fatal car crash aged 20</p><h3>10. Lazio Vs Bologna</h3><p class=align-left>Both Lazio and Bologna will be coming to this match bearing winner tags after a blissful weekend that saw them walk away with three points each. Lazio has had an impressive season after 36 matches and is currently eighth, just two points behind Torino. With two matches remaining, they eye the possibility of playing in the Europa League come to the 2019/2020 campaign. A win will steer them to 61 points, just one point behind Roma who is currently sixth.</p><p class=align-left>Lazio has won three of their last five games, losing only two. Bologna, on the other hand, have nothing to play for after potentially avoiding relegation, thanks to their victory last weekend. They have also won three of their last five fixtures, lost one, and drawn one. Winning will have no such effect as they remain at the centre of the Serie A table. In our analysis, we predict that Lazio will emerge with a straight win.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Lazio to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 3 – 1</p><p class=align-left>For Serie A fans, the league is still on until the climax, despite Juventus’ early triumph. Last weekend was a combination of surprise results, and this week proves to be even hotter. Our today betting tips are based on team analysis, their current form, their past performances, and their ambition.
