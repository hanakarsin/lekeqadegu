"Along your journey, you’re going to have people tell you no, laugh at your idea, and try to discourage you. If you believe in your vision, ultimately you will succeed."</p><p>Along with stressing the importance of a work-life balance, Lo also encouraged those in attendance of finding a strong support system — or taking advantage of easily accessible resources, like the tools, workshops, and incredible expert advice available on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express' Business Class platform</a>.</p><p>"When I started Love Wellness, I found great supporters in my family and the wellness experts that I worked with to formulate products," she continued. "I was lucky enough to be surrounded by other female founders and entrepreneurs who really encouraged me to keep going."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lo Bosworth has big plans for Love Wellness — and Target was just the beginning.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lo Bosworth (@lobosworth)</a></p></figure><p>Love Wellness is a women's wellness company that focuses on natural solutions for natural problems, and offers a range of products from daily multivitamins to personal care items.</p><p>And while admits Love Wellness hitting Target shelves was a career highlight —&nbsp;"I brought my whole family to see it in person and it was such a special moment!" —&nbsp;she has more plans to continue growing the brand, which is also available at Ulta stores.</p><p>"We have been able to help so many women take control of their health and I believe there is so much more we can bring to them," she added.

"Being in that setting at that age ultimately took a toll on my overall wellbeing. After the show ended, I was better able to prioritize my health and wellness."</p><p>However, she still loves her fans and feels the love on TikTok, where you can easily find clips of the show going viral.</p><p>"My team has shown me these," she said of fans rewatching Laguna Beach and The Hills on social media. "It’s always fun to see how the show has resonated with my generation."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobxurs6srqiqpJ16ra3GrqWaZZKarqS0jKWmr51drLKtuM2eqqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-gorman-speech-impediment.html><span>←</span><span>Does Amanda Gorman Have a Speech Impediment?
